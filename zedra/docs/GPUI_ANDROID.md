# GPUI Android

## Goal

Android is the secondary mobile platform for Zedra. The current renderer stack is:

```text
Android app (Kotlin) -> gpui_android -> gpui_wgpu -> wgpu/Vulkan
```

The app boots and renders, but physical-device scrolling and general FPS need a focused performance pass. Do not port Bevy or rewrite GPUI Android. The working strategy is to keep the existing GPUI Android architecture, preserve GPU state across Android surface lifecycle events, and collect enough timing data to decide the next patch from device evidence.

## Current Architecture

Root app Android code lives in:

- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/dev/zedra/app/MainActivity.kt`
- `crates/zedra/src/android/entry.rs`
- `crates/zedra/src/android/jni.rs`
- `crates/zedra/src/android/sheet.rs`

Framework Android code lives in the vendored GPUI checkout:

- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/ffi.rs`
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/platform.rs`
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/window.rs`
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_wgpu/src/wgpu_renderer.rs`

In the current main checkout, Android surface lifecycle, touch, IME, fling, and Choreographer frame callbacks are owned by `gpui_android`, not by Zedra root `AndroidApp` or a root command queue. Do not reintroduce the older root-side `AndroidApp` / `command_queue` model from scratch worktrees.

`crates/zedra/src/android/jni.rs` is app-specific JNI only: sheets, deeplinks, QR scanner, alerts, native selection, native text input, floating button, dictation preview, notifications, and app metadata. Framework-level hot paths stay in `gpui_android`.

## Investigation Summary

The first successful Android revision proved that GPUI can boot and render on Android. The remaining issue is performance under real interaction, especially drawer movement, markdown scroll, code-editor scroll, fling, and background/foreground.

The likely performance risks were:

- Hot-path Java/Rust logging in touch, IME, key, fling, and inset callbacks.
- Rebuilding renderer/device/atlas on Android surface destroy, recreate, or resize.
- Blocking in `Surface::get_current_texture()` or present/acquire while using the default present mode.
- Lack of aggregated frame timing, making it hard to distinguish GPUI layout work, pending task backlog, surface acquire stalls, and GPU draw time.

The current checkout already has most of the renderer-lifecycle shape needed for Android:

- `WgpuSurfaceConfig::preferred_present_mode`
- `WgpuRenderer::new_with_atlas`
- `WgpuRenderer::update_drawable_size`
- `WgpuRenderer::unconfigure_surface`
- `WgpuRenderer::replace_surface`
- Android window code that preserves the renderer across native surface replacement

The follow-up patch added instrumentation and surface capability logging around that existing structure.

## Bevy Comparison

Bevy is useful as a reference, not as an implementation to copy.

Useful Bevy ideas:

- Treat the surface as lifecycle-managed window state.
- Reconfigure or replace the surface when the native window changes.
- Keep renderer/device resources alive when possible.
- Prefer measurement around acquire/present and app-frame scheduling before changing loop policy.

Ideas not applied yet:

- Parking or substantially changing the Choreographer loop. GPUI Android still needs the Java wakeup path to remain reliable before changing loop ownership.
- Hard-defaulting to `Mailbox`. `Fifo` is universal. `Mailbox` is only useful when the device surface reports support.

## Current Strategy

### Preserve Renderer State

On Android surface destroy:

- Keep the GPUI window and `WgpuRenderer`.
- Call `WgpuRenderer::unconfigure_surface()`.
- Drop surface-sized intermediate textures.
- Skip drawing while the surface is unconfigured.

On Android surface recreate:

- Create a new wgpu surface from the new `ANativeWindow`.
- Call `WgpuRenderer::replace_surface(...)`.
- Keep the same device, queue, pipelines, and atlas.

On Android resize:

- Call `WgpuRenderer::update_drawable_size(...)`.
- If the surface is temporarily unconfigured, update the stored size but avoid touching the stale surface.

This is the main Bevy-inspired part of the strategy: replace/reconfigure the surface, not the renderer.

### Present Mode

Android requests `wgpu::PresentMode::Mailbox` as a preference where supported. `gpui_wgpu` checks `surface_caps.present_modes` and falls back to `Fifo`.

The renderer logs:

- adapter name
- backend
- surface size
- format
- selected present mode
- requested present mode
- alpha mode
- supported present modes
- supported alpha modes
- maximum frame latency

Use this log before assuming the device is actually using `Mailbox`.

### Hot-Path Logs

Per-event logging should stay out of touch, IME, key, fling, inset, and keyboard height paths. Lifecycle logs such as surface created/changed/destroyed are fine. If debugging input routing, add temporary targeted logs with a clear prefix and remove them before finishing.

### AndroidPerf Logs

Use aggregated logs under the `AndroidPerf` target. They should report every 120 samples when there is activity. `samples=120` is the aggregation bucket size, not the FPS; use `sample_window_ms`, `callback_hz`, and `draw_hz` to judge whether callbacks or draw attempts are actually keeping up.

Main-loop instrumentation in `gpui_android::android::ffi` tracks:

- pending task count drained by `AndroidPlatform::process_pending_tasks`
- pending task drain time
- fling processing time
- frame request time
- explicit forced frame count
- fling-active frame count

Kotlin Choreographer instrumentation in `GpuiRuntimeController` tracks:

- posted-delay, frame-time lateness, Choreographer frame-time interval, and
  actual callback-start interval
- time spent reposting the next callback vs time inside the JNI/GPUI frame call
- display refresh/mode reported to the app process for the same callback

GPUI frame instrumentation in `gpui::window` tracks:

- dirty, present-only, idle, throttled, and forced frame counts
- total request-frame callback time
- next-frame callback time
- CPU time spent in `window.draw(cx)`
- platform present time and complete-frame time
- `draw_roots` root/deferred prepaint and paint time, scene items, hitboxes,
  selection fragments, deferred draw counts, and same-frame max-total phase
  decomposition
- `draw_roots stats` per-draw distributions for total draw-roots time, measured
  phase sum, unaccounted overhead, prepaint/paint phases, and nested text
  phases. These stats are computed from the actual draw samples in the bucket,
  not from multiplying an average by a call count.
- `draw_roots sample_row` metric-by-sample rows. Each `s00`..`s29` column is
  one draw cycle, and rows include top-level draw parts, accumulated text
  durations in that same draw, and text-run counts such as `text_runs`,
  `line_layout_runs`, and `backend_layout_runs`.
- `gpui frame slow`, `gpui window_draw slow`, `gpui draw_roots slow`, and
  `renderer slow` immediate rows. These are sparse thresholded rows used to
  match a single visible jank frame to the exact nested draw or renderer phase,
  instead of inferring from a later aggregate bucket.
- `draw_roots sample_row` text paint and glyph backend rows, including
  `text_paint_line_ms`, `text_paint_line_glyph_ms`, `paint_glyph_ms`,
  `paint_glyph_raster_bounds_ms`, `paint_glyph_rasterize_ms`,
  `paint_glyph_atlas_ms`, and glyph counts/atlas hit counts for the same draw.
  These rows are used to test whether Android text cost is in GPUI layout,
  cosmic/swash raster-bounds work, atlas misses, or scene insertion.
- `draw_roots sample_row` top-source rows for root/deferred prepaint and paint,
  such as `root_prepaint_top_source_ms`, `root_prepaint_top_source`,
  `root_prepaint_top_kind`, and `root_prepaint_top_source_samples`. These point
  the slow phase at the element source location and whether the exclusive cost
  came from root layout, element prepaint, or element paint in the same draw
  cycle.
- `draw_roots sample_row` layout-subphase rows for root/deferred prepaint,
  including `*_layout_total_ms`, `*_element_prepaint_ms`,
  `*_layout_request_ms`, `*_layout_compute_ms`, and `*_layout_bounds_ms`.
  These rows split the same draw cycle into GPUI request-layout recursion,
  Taffy compute, and layout-bounds lookup/application.
- `draw_roots sample_row` Taffy measurement source rows, including
  `taffy_measure_top1_source`, `taffy_measure_top1_source_calls`,
  `taffy_measure_top1_source_ms`, and the same top-2 rows. Text elements pass
  their original element source into the measured-layout node, so these rows
  point at concrete app text callsites rather than only the generic GPUI text
  measurement function.
- `draw_roots`-correlated text layout totals, so slow-frame buckets show how
  many text layout calls, relayouts, cache misses, and total text/shape time
  happened inside the same frame bucket instead of only in independent text
  buckets
- `draw_roots`-correlated text-stack totals for `shape_text`, GPUI line-layout
  cache work, and platform backend `layout_line` calls. Use these to separate
  normal repeated text measurement from Android-specific backend shaping cost.
  The line-layout totals also split current-frame cache lookup,
  previous-frame lookup, near-miss scanning, text materialization, cache
  insertion, wrap-boundary computation, and force-width adjustment so a large
  `draw_roots` bucket can be mapped to the specific inner cache or text phase.

GPUI list and text instrumentation tracks:

- Android drawer animation-element frames for `drawer-panel-snap` and
  `drawer-backdrop-snap`, including elapsed animation time, raw/clamped/eased
  delta, done state, and whether the animation requested another frame. This
  separates the visual animation timebase from the drawer snap commit task.
- virtual-list prepaint, layout, and paint time
- uniform-list max-frame decomposition across render, layout, child prepaint,
  visible item count, and slowest item layout/prepaint
- virtual-list layout vs child prepaint time inside `prepaint_items`
- virtual-list max-frame decomposition across measured/cached/visible item
  counts, render-item time, total item-layout time, and slowest item layout
- visible, measured, cached, backfilled, leading-overdraw, and focused list item counts
- slowest per-item `layout_as_root` time and item index
- generic element root layout split into request-layout, Taffy compute-layout, and layout-bounds lookup
- generic element paint timing, including hottest single element, aggregate
  elapsed by source, aggregate elapsed by known source, and aggregate scene
  item count by source
- deferred draw prepaint/paint counts, reuse counts, round count, and slowest deferred draw
- text element layout cache hits vs relayouts, shaped line counts, text length, and wrapping/truncation counts
- text element layout source attribution for the slowest relayout and shape operation
- text element layout identity attribution for Android, including distinct
  layout-instance count, distinct text-content count, most frequently measured
  text layout, and highest-elapsed text layout
- text layout paint timing split into background and foreground line paint,
  with source attribution for the hottest text element
- text element measurement mode, including normal vs nowrap whitespace,
  known/available width, wrap/truncate width use, per-measured-node callback
  index, cache miss reason, width measurement kind, hottest caller source,
  and per-source split for no-layout vs wrap-width-change misses
- text line-layout cache hits/misses for wrapped, plain, and hashed line layouts
- text shaping and wrap-boundary timing
- text line-layout near-miss attribution, separating cold cache misses from
  same-text misses caused by wrap width, font size, or font-run changes
- text line-wrapper truncation timing, including per-truncation character-width
  calls, width-cache hits/misses, and slowest single-character width lookup
- high-level text `shape_text` split into font-run construction and line-layout
  cache work
- Android cosmic-text backend `layout_line` split into attr construction,
  `ShapeLine` creation, `layout_to_buffer`, and glyph conversion
- Android cosmic-text backend single-character layout counts and timing, so
  truncation or wrapping width probes can be separated from full-line shaping
- Android text backend lock timing, including write-lock wait time, locked
  layout time, font database face count, loaded-font count, and family-cache
  size
- Android text backend font loading timing, including lock wait, load time,
  requested font batches, font database face-count growth, loaded-font count,
  and family-cache size
- Android `gpui_android` currently enables cosmic-text `shape-run-cache` for
  diagnostic comparison against repeated `ShapeLine::new` costs caused by
  GPUI/Taffy text measurement misses.
- text paint-line timing split into font bounding-box lookup and glyph paint
  calls, with glyph and visible-glyph counts
- renderer `sample_row` rows under `AndroidPerf renderer sample_row`, with
  `s000`..`s119` columns for the renderer draws in a bucket. These rows split
  WGPU/Vulkan-side work such as `renderer_acquire_ms`, `renderer_encode_ms`,
  `renderer_submit_ms`, `renderer_present_ms`, sprite/batch counts, and mono
  sprite batching density. The encode rows also split command encoder creation,
  render-pass begin/drop, batch iteration, per-batch draw calls, per-primitive
  draw calls, and instance-buffer byte counts so WGPU CPU encoding can be
  separated from surface present/backpressure.
- GPUI frame `sample_row` rows under `AndroidPerf gpui frame sample_row`, with
  `s000`..`s119` columns for callback samples. These rows show dirty vs
  present-only vs forced frames and split callback, update, window draw,
  present, and complete-frame timing.
- WGPU instance-batch reuse optimization: plain instance batches reuse one
  full instance-buffer bind group and draw from a nonzero first-instance range.
  On Android, monochrome text batches also reuse one texture+instance bind group
  per atlas texture within the frame when the shared instance binding covers the
  batch. Consecutive Android mono batches now also keep the mono pipeline and
  globals bind group active, so only the atlas texture binding changes between
  text batches. Compare high-batch buckets against `avg_encode_ms`,
  `renderer_draw_mono_ms`, `renderer_draw_quads_ms`, `renderer_present_ms`,
  `AndroidPerf renderer mono sprites avg_bind_group_ms`,
  `avg_set_pipeline_ms`, and `avg_set_globals_bind_group_ms`.
- Renderer slow rows include mono fragmentation probes:
  `mono_order_count`, `mono_order_texture_runs`, `mono_texture_switches`,
  `mono_after_non_mono`, `mono_after_mono_texture_switch`, and
  `mono_after_mono_same_texture`. Use these to distinguish text broken by
  draw-order/interleaved primitive barriers from text broken by atlas texture
  switching.

Use `scripts/android-perf-summary.py --draw-roots-matrix <log>` for per-draw
GPUI rows, `scripts/android-perf-summary.py --renderer-matrix <log>` for
per-renderer rows, and `scripts/android-perf-summary.py --frame-matrix <log>`
for frame callback rows. Pass `--matrix-all` to print all buckets instead of
only the latest bucket.
- per-glyph paint timing split into raster-bounds lookup, sprite-atlas
  lookup/insert, scene insertion, atlas hit/miss count, render mode, and
  subpixel variant distribution
- Android swash glyph image rendering timing, including image content kind,
  grayscale/subpixel/emoji counts, glyph pixel count, and rendered byte size
- WGPU sprite-atlas lookup timing, including hit/miss count, miss build time,
  allocation time, queued-upload bytes, pending-upload count, cached-tile count,
  and texture kind
- WGPU atlas upload flush timing, including per-frame upload count, byte count,
  max single upload, and total flush time
- Taffy measured-node callback source attribution for the slowest measured layout
  and same-compute max-total measurement count/time
- Taffy measured-node source distribution, including distinct measured sources,
  hottest source by call count, hottest source by elapsed time, and the
  definite/min/max constraint shape for measured callbacks
- `draw_roots`-correlated Taffy totals, including `taffy_compute_ms`,
  `taffy_measure_ms`, `taffy_non_measure_ms`, `taffy_compute_calls`,
  `taffy_measure_calls`, repeated root-compute count, and root child count.
  Use these with the layout-subphase rows to tell whether slow prepaint is
  Taffy traversal itself or measured-node callbacks such as text.

Zedra markdown instrumentation tracks:

- markdown preview render rate and top-level block count
- visible markdown row materialization time
- row kind counts for paragraph, heading, block quote, list, code, table, HTML, rule, spacer, and empty rows
- nested block count per row so large list/quote rows are visible in the aggregate

Zedra code-editor instrumentation tracks:

- editor render rate, line count, bottom spacer count, and line-cache rebuild time
- visible row callback time and row/spacer count per callback

Zedra drawer instrumentation tracks:

- `DrawerHost` render rate, overlay frames, drag frames, snap-animation frames, offset ratio, and host render time
- `WorkspaceDrawer` render rate, active drawer tab/mode, and drawer content render time

Zedra benchmark instrumentation tracks:

- active benchmark case markers with content type, row count, and uniform-list flag
- benchmark view render rate and render time, with the slowest bucket annotated
  by benchmark id, content type, row count, and uniform-list flag

Terminal instrumentation in `zedra-terminal` tracks when the terminal view is part of the repro:

- terminal render snapshot time, including content cloning and visible-link detection
- terminal paint layout time and visible cell/link/run counts
- text shaping/paint time for batched terminal runs
- background rectangle, underline, cursor, deferred bookkeeping, and bounds reconcile time

Renderer instrumentation in `gpui_wgpu::WgpuRenderer::draw` tracks:

- sample window time and draw attempt rate
- atlas `before_frame` time, which includes queued sprite-atlas upload flushing
- surface acquire time
- total draw time
- presented vs skipped frames
- last draw status such as `presented`, `unconfigured`, `suboptimal`, `lost_or_outdated`, `timeout_or_occluded`, `validation`, or `instance_buffer_full`

## 2026-05-09 Glyph Cache Finding

The current confirmed root cause for the 10k text benchmark jank is cold glyph
atlas miss work during GPUI root paint.

Captured logs:

- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260509-205102.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260509-205102-androidperf.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-androidperf-summary-20260509-205102.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-gfxinfo-20260509-205102.txt`

Repro case:

- Settings -> Developer -> `Text / 10000 / Uniform List`
- Randomized text rows with random text style/color.

Key bucket:

```text
AndroidPerf gpui frame max_total_ms=1016.831 max_window_draw_ms=930.110
AndroidPerf gpui draw_roots max_total_ms=928.680 max_total_root_paint_ms=885.878
AndroidPerf paint glyph samples=4096 atlas_misses=587 avg_total_ms=0.217 avg_raster_bounds_ms=0.109 avg_atlas_ms=0.106 avg_scene_insert_ms=0.001
```

The arithmetic lines up:

```text
4096 glyph paint calls * 0.217ms average = 888.832ms
```

That matches the `885.878ms` root paint stall closely enough to identify the
root bottleneck. The split shows the time is not scene insertion:

- raster-bounds lookup/render work: about half the stall
- atlas lookup/miss/rasterization work: about half the stall
- scene insertion: negligible

Renderer and GPU upload cost are secondary in this trace:

```text
AndroidPerf wgpu atlas flush max_flush_ms=21.821
AndroidPerf renderer max_atlas_before_frame_ms=21.827
AndroidPerf renderer max_draw_ms=84.405
```

Those numbers can still cause visible hitching, but they do not explain the
900ms root-paint stall.

The issue is cold-cache behavior, not steady-state text paint. Later buckets
drop to `atlas_misses=0..3`, `avg_total_ms=0.004..0.006`, and
`wgpu atlas lookup hits=4096 misses=0`.

First fix target:

- first reduce double swash work on a glyph miss. Android computes raster
  bounds via `render_glyph_image`, then atlas miss rasterization calls
  `render_glyph_image` again for the same `RenderGlyphParams`.
- then measure whether one render per new glyph is still too expensive before
  adding any miss budget, prewarm path, or prepare-phase queue.
- do not spend more time on uniform-list rendering, markdown parsing, text
  layout, scene insertion, or surface acquire for this specific stall unless a
  new trace contradicts this finding.

First fix applied:

- `gpui_android::android::text_system` now keeps a bounded, same-params swash
  image handoff cache. `raster_bounds` stores the rendered image, and
  `rasterize_glyph` consumes it for the immediate atlas-miss bitmap path. This
  preserves the existing GPUI paint/atlas contract while removing the confirmed
  duplicate swash render for cold glyph misses.

## 2026-05-09 Text Rasterizer Follow-up

The handoff cache fixed the duplicate swash render on an atlas miss. It did
not make Android glyph generation cheap enough.

Post-fix captured logs:

- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260509-210137.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260509-210137-androidperf.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-androidperf-summary-20260509-210137.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-gfxinfo-20260509-210137.txt`

Key post-fix buckets:

```text
AndroidPerf paint glyph samples=4096 atlas_misses=587 avg_total_ms=0.116 avg_raster_bounds_ms=0.111 avg_atlas_ms=0.004 avg_scene_insert_ms=0.001
AndroidPerf glyph render image samples=512 avg_pixels=384.7 avg_total_ms=0.593 max_total_ms=2.935
AndroidPerf glyph render image samples=512 avg_pixels=448.7 avg_total_ms=0.807 max_total_ms=1.916
AndroidPerf gpui draw_roots max_total_root_paint_ms=476.862
```

The important shift is:

- `avg_atlas_ms` dropped from about `0.106ms` to about `0.004ms`, so the
  duplicate render inside the atlas miss path is gone.
- `avg_raster_bounds_ms` is still about `0.111ms`, so one swash render per cold
  glyph remains expensive.
- `4096 * 0.116ms = 475.136ms`, which matches the remaining root-paint stall.

That means a queue, budget, or prewarm path can protect frame latency, but it is
not the root fix. The root fix must reduce cold glyph generation cost or replace
the raster backend.

Current backend facts:

- Android GPUI shapes with `cosmic-text`, rasterizes with `swash`, and inserts
  the resulting bitmap into GPUI's sprite atlas:
  `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/text_system.rs`.
- `Window::paint_glyph` synchronously asks for raster bounds, then inserts the
  glyph bitmap into the atlas on a miss:
  `vendor/zed/crates/gpui/src/window.rs`.
- Zedra Android currently keeps `minSdk 23`: `android/build.gradle`.
- The comparable iOS path uses the platform text stack, CoreText/CoreGraphics,
  in `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_ios/src/ios/text_system.rs`.

Candidate paths:

1. FreeType A/B raster backend.
   Keep `cosmic-text` shaping, font matching, glyph IDs, GPUI scene insertion,
   and the existing WGPU atlas. Replace only the grayscale glyph bounds/raster
   backend for non-emoji glyphs, then measure the same AndroidPerf buckets.
   This is the narrowest root-cause experiment.
2. Android native raster backend.
   On API 31+, `android.graphics.fonts.Font#getGlyphBounds` and
   `Canvas#drawGlyphs` can consume glyph IDs. That can preserve
   `cosmic-text` shaping if the Android `Font` object is built from the same
   font bytes and the glyph IDs match. It cannot be the only backend while
   `minSdk` remains 23.
3. GPU/path/SDF text architecture.
   This could reduce CPU rasterization more fundamentally, but it is a larger
   renderer change because GPUI currently paints bitmap glyph sprites into an
   atlas. Treat this as research unless the narrower rasterizer A/B still shows
   unacceptable per-glyph cost.

Research notes:

- Prefer direct `freetype-sys` for the first FreeType A/B. It can consume the
  exact font bytes already loaded for `cosmic-text`, use the shaped glyph ID,
  and avoid fontconfig. `freetype-sys` skips `pkg-config` for Android targets
  and has a bundled-source build path.
- Do not enable GPUI's full desktop `font-kit` feature for Android as the first
  attempt. In the current dependency shape it pulls `zed-font-kit` and then
  `yeslogic-fontconfig-sys` for non-macOS/iOS/Windows targets, which is exactly
  the cross-compile surface to avoid.
- Keep swash as the fallback and emoji path during the A/B. FreeType can handle
  basic bitmap/color cases, but modern color emoji and COLR/SVG details are
  higher regression risk than the normal text path being measured.
- `glyphon` is useful reading, but it is mostly lateral for this root cause:
  it is also `wgpu` + `cosmic-text` + a cached rasterized glyph atlas.
- SDF/MSDF is the closest incremental renderer change that could reduce
  per-size glyph generation for monochrome editor/terminal text while keeping
  GPUI's shaped glyph positions and atlas/sprite model. The risk is small-text
  quality, hinting loss, large CJK/Unicode sets, and color emoji.
- Vello/Slug-style GPU outline rendering is the bigger architectural direction.
  It removes precomputed bitmap/field atlas generation, but requires new
  renderer primitives or passes rather than a small Android text-system patch.

Implementation status:

- `gpui_android` now depends directly on `freetype-sys = "0.20.1"`.
- `gpui_android::android::text_system` creates a FreeType library and a
  memory-backed FreeType face for each loaded `cosmic-text` font.
- FreeType is used only for non-emoji grayscale glyphs. Swash remains the
  fallback and the emoji/color path.
- FreeType glyph output is still inserted through the existing GPUI sprite
  atlas contract. Shaping, fallback selection, scene insertion, and WGPU atlas
  upload are unchanged.
- `AndroidPerf glyph render image` now includes `swash=` and `freetype=`
  counts so the device logs show which backend produced the sampled glyphs.
- Validation passed after this change:
  `cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -t armeabi-v7a -t x86_64 check --manifest-path vendor/zed/Cargo.toml -p gpui_android`,
  `./scripts/build-android.sh --target=arm64-v8a`, and
  `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

Research questions for the next patch:

- Can FreeType build and link for `cargo ndk` without pulling fontconfig?
  `zed-font-kit` has separate `loader-freetype` and `source-fontconfig`
  features; enabling GPUI's full `font-kit` feature currently pulls fontconfig,
  which is not the Android path we want.
- Can `cosmic_text::Font::data()` provide the exact font bytes needed to create
  a FreeType face for the selected fallback font?
- Can FreeType compute bounds from `FT_Load_Glyph` metrics before
  `FT_Render_Glyph`, avoiding a bitmap render just to answer
  `glyph_raster_bounds`?
- Does FreeType grayscale/hinting output match current visual quality enough on
  Android? Measure sharpness and placement, not only time.
- How should emoji and color glyphs behave? A likely first pass is FreeType for
  normal mask glyphs and swash/native fallback for color emoji.
- Does subpixel positioning matter? Android currently logs only one y variant
  and grayscale text, so the first A/B can start with the existing mask path.

## Summarizing Logs

Use `scripts/android-perf-summary.py` to collapse raw log output into
per-instrument bucket counts and numeric field statistics. The helper reports
`count`, `min`, `p25`, `avg`, `mean`, `p50`, `p75`, and `max` for every
selected numeric field, plus the slowest raw buckets for the preferred timing
field. It parses both `AndroidPerf` and `IosPerf` so Android and iOS traces can
be compared with the same output shape.

From an existing AndroidPerf extract:

```sh
scripts/android-perf-summary.py /tmp/zedra-android-logcat-androidperf.log --top 3
```

From raw logcat:

```sh
adb logcat -d -v threadtime | scripts/android-perf-summary.py -
```

To print the latest `draw_roots sample_row` bucket as a matrix where each
column is one draw cycle. The matrix includes top-source rows for root/deferred
prepaint and paint, so the source owning the slow phase can be compared against
text and scene metrics in the same sample column:

```sh
scripts/android-perf-summary.py /tmp/zedra-android-logcat-androidperf.log --draw-roots-matrix
```

To print GPUI frame callback samples and see whether present cost is happening
during dirty, present-only, forced, idle, or throttled callbacks:

```sh
scripts/android-perf-summary.py /tmp/zedra-android-logcat-androidperf.log --frame-matrix
```

From iOS `IosPerf` logs:

```sh
./scripts/ios-log.sh tail --filter IosPerf | tee /tmp/zedra-iosperf.log
scripts/android-perf-summary.py --prefix IosPerf /tmp/zedra-iosperf.log --top 3
```

Use `--all-fields` when the default timing/count field filter hides a field you
need for a one-off investigation.

## iOS Comparison Buckets

iOS now emits `IosPerf` buckets for the shared GPUI hot paths that Android logs
as `AndroidPerf`:

- `gpui frame`, `gpui draw`, and `gpui draw_roots`
- `element root layout` and `element paint`
- `taffy compute`
- `list`, `uniform list`, and deferred draw buckets
- `text element layout`, `text layout paint`, `text paint line`,
  `text shape_text`, `text line layout`, `text line wrapper truncate`, and
  `paint glyph`
- iOS-specific `renderer` timing from the Metal renderer

The Metal `renderer` bucket measures CPU-side drawable acquire, primitive
encoding, and present/commit scheduling. It does not include Android WGPU
surface status fields or GPU completion time, so compare it against Android's
renderer encode/draw directionally, not as identical backend telemetry.

## 2026-05-10 Root Dev Profile Finding

The current Android repro builds through the root Zedra workspace. That matters
because the root workspace excludes `vendor/zed`, so profile overrides in
`vendor/zed/Cargo.toml` do not apply to Android app builds.

Zed's vendored workspace optimizes `taffy` in dev builds. Before the root
profile update, `scripts/run-android.sh` defaulted to the Android debug APK and
also passed `--debug` to `scripts/build-android.sh`, so hot layout/text
dependencies were built with normal Rust dev-codegen settings while the app
kept debug assertions and developer benchmark views.

This matches the 2026-05-10 Android logs:

- `AndroidPerf taffy compute` showed very high total layout time.
- The measured text callback time was much smaller than total Taffy time in the
  worst buckets, so the gap was inside pure layout work, not only text shaping.
- iOS simulator logs using the same shared GPUI buckets showed low Taffy and
  text-layout cost. That comparison is directional only because simulator and
  Android physical-device hardware differ, but it confirms the shared probes are
  able to show the same bucket names at much lower cost.

Root `Cargo.toml` now keeps hot GPUI layout/text dependencies optimized in the
dev profile:

- `taffy`
- `cosmic-text`, `swash`, `fontdb`, `harfrust`, `rustybuzz`, `skrifa`,
  `ttf-parser`
- Unicode line/shaping support crates used by that text stack

This keeps `debug_assertions` enabled for developer-only benchmark views while
removing a major debug-build performance amplifier. The next Android install
should be a normal debug install, then the key comparison is whether
`AndroidPerf taffy compute`, `text backend layout_line`, and `gpui draw_roots`
drop without changing app behavior.

## 2026-05-10 WGPU Batch Encoding Finding

Per-batch WGPU bind group churn was a real Android backend bottleneck, separate
from the text rasterizer cost.

Relevant post-optimization logs:

- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260510-175644-pid18254-androidperf.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-summary-20260510-175644-pid18254.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-renderer-matrix-20260510-175644-pid18254.tsv`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-draw-matrix-20260510-175644-pid18254.tsv`

Applied optimization:

- Plain instance batches share one buffer-wide instance bind group and use
  `first_instance` to select the batch range.
- Android monochrome text batches share one texture+instance bind group per
  atlas texture within a frame when the batch is covered by the shared instance
  binding.
- Consecutive Android monochrome text batches keep the same mono pipeline and
  globals bind group bound; the renderer only changes the texture+instance bind
  group between batches.
- Batches fall back to the old per-batch bind group path when the offset cannot
  be represented as a typed instance index or the batch exceeds the shared
  binding range.

Validated result:

- Before: `avg_batches=61`, `max_batches=174`, `avg_encode_ms=6.782`,
  `max_encode_ms=24.037`.
- After: the worst high-batch bucket was `avg_batches=21.9`,
  `max_batches=105`, `avg_encode_ms=1.390`, `max_encode_ms=5.814`.
- The remaining high-encode samples are still dominated by monochrome text
  batch count. One sample had `renderer_encode_ms=5.814`,
  `renderer_mono_batches=99`, and `renderer_mono_sprites=1022`.

Remaining signals:

- Some slow renderer samples are now present/backpressure dominated. Example:
  `renderer_draw_ms=18.323`, `renderer_encode_ms=1.521`, and
  `renderer_present_ms=13.316`.
- GPUI draw-root spikes still exist above the renderer. One sample had
  `draw_total_ms=35.907`, `root_prepaint_ms=22.818`,
  `taffy_compute_ms=10.123`, `text_layout_ms=4.623`, and
  `text_runs=1261`.
- A text-backend layout spike remains possible:
  `backend_layout_ms=6.444`, `shape_text_ms=7.736`,
  `line_layout_ms=7.046`.

Next useful probes:

- Separate present/backpressure from CPU encoding in the Android WGPU surface
  path.
- Reduce or explain monochrome text tiny-batch fragmentation.
- Keep draw-root sample rows tied to a single render cycle so GPUI layout, text
  layout, renderer encode, and present timing can be compared directly.
- Check `mono_order_texture_runs` and `mono_after_non_mono` in renderer slow
  rows before changing batching semantics.

## 2026-05-11 Android Monochrome Atlas Texture Churn Finding

The next renderer probes showed that remaining mono text encode cost was not
primarily from quads or other primitives interrupting text order. Slow renderer
rows had `mono_after_non_mono=2..4`, but `mono_after_mono_texture_switch` was
often `56..74` and `mono_after_mono_same_texture=0`. A single code-editor draw
could have two mono atlas textures and `mono_order_texture_runs=75..96`.

That means many text orders are being split because glyphs for the same visible
rows live on two monochrome atlas textures. The WGPU atlas previously searched
existing textures from newest to oldest, so once a second monochrome atlas
existed, newly seen glyphs tended to land there while common glyphs stayed in
the first atlas.

Applied optimization:

- Android monochrome atlas allocation now searches oldest to newest, keeping new
  glyphs in the primary mono atlas while it still has room.
- Android monochrome atlases use a `2048x2048` default size, clamped by the
  device max texture size. R8 mono atlas memory grows from about 1 MB to about
  4 MB per atlas, which is a small tradeoff compared with repeated CPU-side WGPU
  texture bind churn during text-heavy frames.

The expected validation signal is fewer mono atlas textures in normal editor
use, lower `mono_order_texture_runs`, and fewer
`mono_after_mono_texture_switch` counts in `AndroidPerf renderer slow` rows.

## 2026-05-10 Android Present-Only Frame Pacing Finding

Later immediate slow rows showed a second Android-backend bottleneck: GPUI could
submit full WGPU presents for unchanged scene content after high-rate input.

Relevant logs:

- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260510-183908-pid24696-androidperf.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-summary-20260510-183908-pid24696.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-frame-matrix-20260510-183908-pid24696.tsv`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-renderer-matrix-20260510-183908-pid24696.tsv`

Finding:

- Kotlin drives `gpuiRequestFrame()` from `Choreographer` every vsync.
- GPUI's shared high-rate input tracker sustained presentation for one second
  after >=60 Hz input, even if the window was not dirty.
- On Android, that meant repeated `present_only` frames with `window_draw=0`,
  while WGPU/SurfaceView `present()` still blocked for roughly 13-18 ms on the
  physical Mali/Vulkan device.
- These present-only stalls happened before and around file-open/editor
  transitions, so they could consume the UI thread independently of editor text
  layout or row construction.

Applied optimization:

- Android now disables only the high-rate-input sustain-presentation path.
- Dirty frames, forced redraws, explicit `require_presentation`, and real
  content-changing scroll/fling frames still present normally.
- The expected validation signal is that `gpui frame slow kind=present_only`
  rows largely disappear, while remaining jank should concentrate in dirty
  `draw_roots`, renderer encode, or renderer present rows.

## 2026-05-11 Initial Dirty Draw Investigation

After disabling Android present-only sustain, slow samples are expected dirty
draws. Treat `kind=dirty` as the trigger, not the diagnosis.

Current interpretation:

- File open and editor replacement legitimately require a cold draw.
- A code file naturally creates many text runs and many monochrome text batches.
- The remaining question is why that first required draw is too expensive on
  Android compared with iOS.

Active probe:

- `gpui draw_roots slow` is paired with `gpui draw_roots layout_slow`.
- The companion row splits the same draw into root/deferred prepaint layout,
  element prepaint, layout request, Taffy compute, layout-bounds lookup, Taffy
  text-measure callbacks, and their top source locations.
- `renderer slow` now includes per-sample monochrome tiny-batch counts so encode
  cost can be separated from expected text-run count.
- Periodic aggregate bucket logs are currently gated off during file-open
  repros. They can perturb the UI thread when several large summaries flush on
  the same frame; rely on immediate slow rows for clean cold-draw samples.

## 2026-05-11 File-Open Query Compilation Fix

The repeated file-open jank had one confirmed app-side cause before the next
GPUI backend pass: `EditorView::set_content` synchronously created a Rust
highlighter, and that compiled the tree-sitter highlight query on the UI thread.

Pre-fix evidence:

- Logs:
  - `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260511-133948-pid25726-androidperf.log`
  - `/tmp/zedra-android-summary-20260511-133948-pid25726.txt`
- Rust files spent roughly `159-178ms` in `editor set_content`, almost all in
  `highlighter_ms`.
- `Highlighter::new` showed `query_ms` around `159-176ms` for Rust, including a
  tiny `427` byte / `24` line Rust file. The cost was therefore query
  compilation, not file size, buffer replacement, or editor cache rebuild.
- Plain text files stayed near `0.1ms` in `editor set_content`, confirming the
  tree-sitter query boundary.

Zed reference:

- Upstream Zed stores compiled `tree_sitter::Query` values on
  `language_core::Grammar`, then holds those grammars behind cached
  `Arc<Language>` values in `LanguageRegistry`.
- `SyntaxMap` and buffer highlighting borrow the already-compiled grammar query
  rather than recompiling queries for each file open.
- Zedra's simplified mobile editor had been treating `Highlighter` as
  parser/query/tree per file open, which was the wrong ownership shape for
  Android.

Applied optimization:

- `crates/zedra/src/editor/syntax_highlighter.rs` now keeps a per-language
  `Arc<Query>` cache and gives each highlighter a parser/tree plus a shared
  compiled query.
- `Highlighter::pending_for_filename(...)` creates a parser-free and query-free
  placeholder for UI-thread file replacement.
- `crates/zedra/src/editor/code_editor.rs` now installs that pending highlighter
  from `EditorView::set_content`. The background `ParsedEditorSyntax::build`
  task still creates/parses the real highlighter and `apply_parsed_syntax`
  installs the parsed result.
- Do not reintroduce `Highlighter::from_filename(...)` or `Query::new` on the
  UI-thread `set_content` path. The pending highlighter exists specifically to
  keep file-open/drawer transitions free of tree-sitter query compilation.

Post-fix evidence:

- Logs:
  - `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260511-135611-pid28015-androidperf.log`
  - `/tmp/zedra-android-summary-20260511-135611-pid28015.txt`
  - `/tmp/zedra-gfxinfo-20260511-135611-pid28015.txt`
- `editor set_content`: avg `4.409ms`, p75 `5.621ms`, max `12.805ms`.
- The first Rust `Query::new` still cost `197.898ms`, but it ran on a
  background thread. Later Rust highlighter creation hit the cache:
  `query_ms=0.013-0.077ms`.
- `syntax_apply_apply_done` stayed tiny, usually `0.024-0.069ms`, so applying
  parsed syntax back to the editor is not the UI-thread stall.
- Background syntax parse/highlight can still take tens to hundreds of
  milliseconds for large files. That work is no longer the drawer-close UI
  blocker, but it can trigger the next full syntax draw when it completes.

Remaining bottleneck after this fix:

- Slow dirty frames now point at GPUI editor row layout/prepaint, especially
  after syntax apply or full editor redraw.
- Worst post-fix samples:
  - `gpui frame slow total_ms=101.082`, `window_draw_ms=74.443`.
  - `gpui draw_roots slow total_ms=70.851`, `root_prepaint_ms=58.621`,
    `root_prepaint_layout_ms=42.997`.
  - `taffy_compute_ms=21.251`, `taffy_measure_ms=10.964`.
  - top source: `crates/zedra/src/editor/code_editor.rs:447`, the per-row
    `div()` in the code editor uniform list.
- Renderer work during those same samples is lower and not the primary cause:
  `renderer draw_ms=16.686`, with mono draw around `1.756ms`.

Current conclusion:

- The old file-open `Query::new` UI-thread stall is fixed.
- The next investigation boundary is GPUI/editor row layout and prepaint on
  Android, not tree-sitter query compilation.

## 2026-05-11 Periodic HostInfo Redraw Finding

After the query-compilation fix, the app still produced slow dirty frames even
when no new file was opened. The repeated samples lined up with the host stats
period, not with editor content replacement.

Evidence:

- Host info is sampled by the host every `5s`.
- Android logs after the last file open still showed `gpui draw_roots
  layout_slow` roughly every `5s`.
- The dirty source was `workspace.rs` handling host info, followed by broad
  `WorkspaceState` observers such as the file explorer and workspace content.
- `cx.notify()` only invalidates views tracking that entity, but `WorkspaceState`
  is a high-level display entity. Marking it dirty can invalidate the
  editor/explorer/drawer path and defeat nested prepaint reuse for that frame.

Applied optimization:

- `HostInfoState` now owns the transient host resource snapshot.
- The host-info listener updates `HostInfoState`, not `WorkspaceState`.
- The Session panel observes `HostInfoState` directly, so the stats row still
  updates while editor, explorer, and workspace content avoid the periodic broad
  redraw.

Expected validation:

- The recurring `5s` dirty `draw_roots/layout_slow` samples should disappear or
  shrink when the visible Session panel is not the active source of work.
- This is not expected to solve all Android jank. It removes a confirmed
  periodic redraw amplifier; file-open cold draws, Android text/layout backend
  cost, and renderer batching/present timing remain separate suspects.

## 2026-05-11 Two-Track Performance Strategy

Keep the investigation split into two active tracks.

Track 1: app and GPUI scene cost.

- Optimize the editor, list-heavy panels, file explorer, and git diff views so
  they do not create avoidable layout or text-measure work.
- Treat code editor, file explorer, git diff, markdown, and benchmark views as
  repro surfaces for the same GPUI list/text/layout pipeline.
- The current evidence after the HostInfo split points at virtualized editor
  rows and text elements: repeated dirty draws still show `code_editor.rs` row
  layout/prepaint and styled-text measurement/paint as the largest required-draw
  costs.

Track 2: Android rendering backend smoothness.

- Keep probing `gpui_android`, `gpui_wgpu`, Android text/glyph rasterization,
  atlas upload, WGPU/Vulkan present/backpressure, and monochrome text batching.
- A GPU renderer should feel smoother than a WebView once scene construction is
  cheap enough. If it does not, the backend path still has work to do.
- Use cached-scene and text-heavy benchmark views to separate backend smoothness
  from app/editor row construction.

The latest validation signal:

- No periodic `workspace.rs` HostInfo dirty source remained after the split.
- After the last editor slow frame in the 2026-05-11 `14:55` log, the main loop
  stayed near `61Hz` with tiny frame-request time.
- Remaining slow rows were file-open/editor/drawer dirty draws, not idle
  periodic telemetry redraws.

## 2026-05-11 Drawer Present-Path Probe

The drawer toggle animation is the current minimal repro for Android backend
smoothness. It keeps app-level work small enough that slow frames are easier to
attribute below GPUI.

Latest captured logs:

- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260511-172734.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-android-logcat-20260511-172734-androidperf.log`
- `/tmp/zedra-gfxinfo-20260511-172734.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-display-20260511-172734.txt`
- `/tmp/zedra-surfaceflinger-20260511-172734.txt`

Signal from that capture:

- Drawer open target `160ms` stretched to roughly `278..355ms`.
- Drawer close target `100ms` stretched to roughly `234..298ms`.
- Drawer render and action-handler costs were tiny; this was not a drawer
  content render bottleneck.
- GPUI text/layout was not the dominant cost in this repro. `draw_roots
  text_layout` stayed around `1ms` average, with only small spikes.
- WGPU CPU work before present was small: acquire, encode, finish, and submit
  were usually a few milliseconds total.
- The dominant renderer phase was `frame.present()`: `present_ms` averaged about
  `15..16ms`, with p75 around `20ms` and max around `30ms`.
- App-side Choreographer logs reported `120Hz`, while SurfaceFlinger dumpsys at
  capture time reported an active `60Hz` composition mode. Treat this as an
  active suspect, not a conclusion, until per-layer latency confirms it.

Use `scripts/android-render-capture.sh` to capture this next boundary:

```sh
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull
```

The helper saves logcat, AndroidPerf summaries/matrices, `gfxinfo`,
`dumpsys display`, full SurfaceFlinger state, and `SurfaceFlinger --latency`
for matching app layers. The layer latency summary is the key next artifact for
checking whether `frame.present()` is blocking because the app is pacing at
120Hz while the SurfaceView/BLAST/SurfaceFlinger path presents at 60Hz.

The next A/B should use the debug-only render pacing controls. Apply one mode,
rerun the same drawer toggle capture, then compare `renderer present_ms`,
`gpui frame present_ms`, Choreographer `callback_hz`, and SurfaceFlinger layer
latency:

```sh
scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate none --present-mode mailbox
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 60 --present-mode mailbox
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 120 --present-mode mailbox
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 60 --present-mode fifo
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 120 --present-mode fifo --frame-driver end
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 120 --present-mode fifo --frame-driver start --frame-latency 3
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate 120 --frame-compat fixed --frame-change always --present-mode fifo --frame-driver start --frame-latency 3
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --present-strategy offload
scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
# manually toggle the drawer several times
scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull

scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --present-strategy inline
```

These controls are diagnostic only:

- `--frame-rate` calls Android `Surface.setFrameRate(...)` on the GPUI
  `SurfaceView` in debug builds. `none` clears the SurfaceView vote.
- `--frame-compat` selects the debug `Surface.setFrameRate` compatibility:
  `default` is the UI/game path; `fixed` is the fixed-source/video-style path.
- `--frame-change` selects the debug refresh-rate change strategy:
  `seamless` keeps Android's default behavior; `always` lets Android use a
  non-seamless display-mode change if the platform decides it is worthwhile.
- `--present-mode` updates the WGPU surface present mode in debug Rust builds.
  `default` is the current Android preference, `Mailbox`.
- `--frame-driver` switches the debug Choreographer repost point. `start`
  preserves the current loop and posts the next callback before
  `gpuiRequestFrame(...)`; `end` posts after the GPUI frame returns. Use this
  only as an A/B probe for catch-up callbacks after slow draws.
- `--frame-latency` updates WGPU
  `SurfaceConfiguration::desired_maximum_frame_latency` in debug Rust builds.
  Keep it at the default `2` unless a capture is explicitly testing Vulkan /
  SurfaceFlinger backpressure.
- `--present-strategy` is a backend-only probe for the WGPU handoff point:
  `inline` is the normal path, `offload` moves `SurfaceTexture::present()` to a
  single worker thread and emits `AndroidPerf renderer async_present`, and
  `discard` drops the acquired surface texture after submit. Use it only to
  isolate whether UI-thread jank follows WGPU/Vulkan present blocking.
- Each change emits `AndroidPerf render_pacing_control` / `render_pacing` rows,
  so captures show which pacing mode was active.

Captured A/B results:

- `none + Mailbox`:
  - Drawer snap target `100/160ms` completed by the commit task in
    `218..358ms`, average `282.6ms`.
  - GPUI frame `present_ms` averaged `21.1ms`; renderer `present_ms` averaged
    `16.0ms`.
  - SurfaceFlinger BLAST layer active intervals were unstable: filtered
    `p50=37.0ms`, `p75=63.9ms`.
- `60Hz vote + Mailbox`:
  - SurfaceFlinger intervals improved but remained unstable: filtered
    `p50=25.9ms`, `p75=42.6ms`.
  - Drawer snap commit did not improve: average `303.4ms`.
  - GPUI frame total stayed effectively unchanged at about `35ms`.
- `60Hz vote + Fifo`:
  - Renderer present improved: average `14.5ms -> 11.9ms`, max
    `29.7ms -> 20.9ms`.
  - GPUI frame total improved: average `35.4ms -> 30.0ms`, max
    `51.1ms -> 37.7ms`.
  - Drawer snap commit still did not improve: average `306.5ms`.
- `60Hz vote + Fifo`, later drawer-tap capture:
  - SurfaceFlinger/layer output was still effectively `60fps`, but app-side
    Choreographer continued to report `120Hz`.
  - GPUI frame total improved only modestly versus the prior `120/Fifo`
    capture: p50 `41.7ms -> 34.9ms`, p75 `46.1ms -> 39.7ms`.
  - Renderer present improved only modestly: p50 `13.6ms -> 11.9ms`, p75
    `17.8ms -> 17.1ms`.
  - This rules out `60Hz` as a real fix. A GPU UI backend should not need to
    cap to 60Hz to be smooth, and this A/B still left visible jank.
  - The same run exposed a separate Android text/font cold path:
    `text backend layout_line` hit about `41ms`, with `android_backend_ms`
    around `60ms` in the correlated `draw_roots` row.
- `120Hz vote + Fifo + frame_driver=start + frame_latency=3`:
  - WGPU `desired_maximum_frame_latency=3` did not fix the backend jank.
  - GPUI frame `present_ms` stayed effectively unchanged versus the default
    latency runs: p50 stayed around `18ms` and p75 around `22ms`.
  - Renderer `present_ms` also stayed in the same band: p50 around `13ms`,
    p75 around `17ms`.
  - The bad frames are mixed: many frames spend about `10..15ms` in GPUI
    window drawing plus `18..30ms` in WGPU present, while cold frames can spend
    much more in window drawing.
  - SurfaceFlinger still shows irregular app-layer presentation, with the
    active BLAST layer around p50 `33ms` and p75 near `99ms` actual interval.
- `120Hz vote + Fifo + frame_driver=start + frame_latency=3`, joined-frame
  follow-up:
  - Text backend was not the bottleneck in this drawer capture. Slow backend
    `layout_line` max was only `0.079ms`, and steady drawer frames had
    `android_backend_ms=0`.
  - Steady bad frames were split between draw and present. Example
    `frame_seq=1529`: GPUI frame `56.2ms`, window draw `19.4ms`, GPUI present
    `35.0ms`; matching `draw_roots` was `18.0ms`, mostly root prepaint/layout
    and root paint, while renderer `present_ms` was `29.8ms`.
  - `div_request` is cumulative/nested; use it as a cost signal, not direct
    wall-clock. It can exceed the same frame's `draw_roots total_ms`.
  - The drawer content was terminal-heavy in this run: about `1896` scene items
    and `1442` mono sprites.

Next backend probe:

- Keep the display/present mode at `120/Fifo`, default the frame driver to
  `start`, and keep `frame_latency=3` for one more capture only because that is
  the active A/B mode. The next isolated question is whether Android is treating
  the GPUI `SurfaceView` as flexible UI content and therefore not selecting a
  useful display mode for the app layer. Test `--frame-compat fixed
  --frame-change always` as a probe only; this is not the expected final policy
  for a UI renderer.
  - The SurfaceFlinger layer latency capture only had two rows in an earlier
    run because the surface was recreated near the end of that run, so do not
    use that specific layer summary as evidence.

Current interpretation:

- `Fifo` is a real backend pacing improvement for Android WGPU present
  blocking, but not the complete drawer-smoothness fix.
- The drawer repro is no longer "render path is cheap" in terminal-heavy app
  state. Steady frames can spend about `16..19ms` in `draw_roots` before the
  additional WGPU present wait.
- The current backend boundary is the combination of scene build/paint cost and
  Android surface presentation pacing. Keep separating those two in the same
  frame with `frame_seq`.

## Reading Results

If `avg_acquire_ms` or `max_acquire_ms` is high:

- Check selected present mode and surface caps.
- Compare `Fifo` vs `Mailbox` on the same physical device.
- Check background/foreground and surface replacement logs for stale surface behavior.

If `avg_draw_ms` is high:

- Inspect scene complexity, markdown/editor row work, drawer content rendering, terminal row count when a terminal is visible, atlas churn, and instance buffer growth.
- Look for repeated `instance_buffer_full`.

If `avg_mono_batches` is high while `avg_mono_sprites` is modest:

- Compare `avg_encode_ms` against `avg_mono_batches`. Hundreds of tiny
  monochrome sprite batches can dominate Android CPU time even when shaping,
  rasterization, atlas lookup, and the actual GPU draw calls are cheap.
- Check `avg_mono_unique_textures`. If it is only a few textures but
  `avg_mono_tiny_batches_4` or `avg_mono_tiny_batches_8` is high, suspect scene
  sprite ordering/batching rather than atlas pressure.
- `AtlasTile::tile_id` is unique only within its atlas texture. Sorting sprites
  by tile id without texture id can interleave textures inside the same draw
  order and force a bind group per tiny run.

If `AndroidPerf paint glyph` is high:

- Check `atlas_misses` first. Hundreds of misses in a bucket mean paint is
  synchronously rasterizing cold glyphs.
- Compare `avg_raster_bounds_ms`, `avg_atlas_ms`, and `avg_scene_insert_ms`.
  If raster bounds and atlas dominate while scene insertion is near zero, the
  fix belongs in glyph raster/cache preparation, not scene construction.
- If the handoff cache is active and `avg_atlas_ms` is low but
  `avg_raster_bounds_ms` remains high, the remaining suspect is the rasterizer
  backend itself, not atlas insertion.
- Compare `AndroidPerf wgpu atlas flush` and renderer
  `max_atlas_before_frame_ms`. Upload flush cost can add a smaller second hitch
  after the CPU-side paint miss work.

If text backend `max_shape_new_ms` is high:

- Compare it with `AndroidPerf text backend lock`. High `max_wait_ms` points at
  text-system lock contention, often from concurrent font loading or glyph
  rasterization. Low wait but high `max_locked_layout_ms` keeps the suspect
  inside cosmic-text shaping/layout itself.
- Check `AndroidPerf text backend font_load` around the same repro. Font
  database growth during scroll can invalidate or perturb backend font matching
  even when upper-layer text layout caches are behaving correctly.
- If embedded app fonts disappear after Android rotation, check whether the
  Activity recreated GPUI's platform/text system in the same process. Zedra's
  embedded font loader must dedupe per text-system instance, not with a
  process-global once guard, or the new Android text system will keep only
  platform-loaded system fonts.
- Rotation should not recreate `MainActivity` for the normal GPUI root surface.
  The Android host declares rotation-related `configChanges` and forwards
  configuration changes into the existing `GpuiRuntimeController`; otherwise
  `onDestroy` clears the platform and the app restarts at Home.
- Check non-ASCII, missing-font-run, font-id-miss, loaded-font, and face-count
  fields before assuming the slow path is caused by markdown, uniform lists, or
  persistent row content.
- Slow `layout_line` rows include only numeric identifiers (`first_cp`,
  `first_run_font_id`, `first_glyph_font_id`, `first_glyph_id`) so cold
  fallback/font-cache paths can be correlated without logging file content.
- Check `single_char_layouts`, `avg_single_char_ms`, and
  `AndroidPerf text line wrapper truncate`. High single-character layout counts
  with width misses point at truncation/wrapping width probes repeatedly shaping
  characters before the final line layout.

If `AndroidPerf gpui draw_roots` has high line-layout time but backend
`layout_line` is much lower:

- Compare `shape_text_font_run_ms`, `shape_text_resolve_font_ms`, and
  `shape_text_font_run_non_resolve_ms` in the draw matrix. If resolve-font time
  is small, the cost is not Android font selection; continue into GPUI text-run
  preparation, line-layout cache lookup, layout compute, or renderer batching.
- Compare `max_total_line_current_lookup_ms`,
  `max_total_line_previous_lookup_ms`, `max_total_line_near_miss_ms`,
  `max_total_line_materialize_ms`, `max_total_line_cache_insert_ms`,
  `max_total_line_wrap_ms`, and `max_total_line_force_width_ms` in the same
  bucket. This separates cache-map work and GPUI text preparation from the
  actual platform text backend call.
- Use the matching `avg_line_*` fields to distinguish one cold spike from
  sustained per-frame overhead during scroll or text-editor interaction.

If `AndroidPerf taffy compute` has high `max_measure_calls` or
`max_total_measure_calls`:

- Check `max_source_calls_source` and `max_source_calls`. If most calls in a
  compute come from one source, the next suspect is repeated measurement of
  that element path rather than broad tree size.
- Check `max_source_elapsed_source` and `max_source_elapsed_ms`. If elapsed
  time follows the same source as call count, the source is both frequently
  measured and individually expensive.
- Check `avg_distinct_measure_sources`. A low value with high measure calls
  points at repeated passes over a small set of measured nodes; a high value
  points at broad visible-tree measurement.
- Check `avg_width_definite_calls`, `avg_width_min_calls`, and
  `avg_width_max_calls`. Text cache misses that follow min/max-content probes
  usually mean layout constraints are forcing intrinsic measurement before the
  final definite-width layout.
- Then check `AndroidPerf text element layout` identity fields. High
  `distinct_layouts` with a low `top_layout_samples` means many visible text
  nodes are participating. Low `distinct_layouts` or a high
  `top_layout_samples`/`top_layout_max_call_index` points at one or a few text
  layouts being remeasured repeatedly.

If `avg_pending_tasks_ms` or `pending_tasks` is high:

- Inspect foreground executor work being drained during frame callbacks.
- Move non-visual or session/network work off the frame-critical path.

If `avg_frame_request_ms` is high:

- Inspect GPUI request-frame callbacks and window scheduling.
- Confirm fling is not routed through GPUI's forced-refresh path. During a
  normal fling, `fling_frames` may increase but `forced_frames` should not climb
  in lockstep.
- Compare it with the `AndroidPerf gpui frame` line. High
  `avg_window_draw_ms` points at CPU scene construction/layout, while high
  `avg_present_ms` points back toward the platform renderer path.
- Then compare app-level logs for the active view:
  `AndroidPerf markdown render`, `AndroidPerf markdown rows`,
  `AndroidPerf editor render`, `AndroidPerf editor rows`,
  `AndroidPerf drawer host`, and `AndroidPerf workspace drawer`.
  High markdown/editor row time points at visible row construction. High drawer
  host time points at overlay/animation wrapping, while high workspace drawer
  time points at the active drawer tab content.
  If the terminal is visible, also compare `AndroidPerf terminal render` and
  `AndroidPerf terminal paint`.

If `framestats` shows sustained jank but AndroidPerf numbers are low:

- Inspect Java/Kotlin work, system UI overlap, Android resource/layout work, and GPU driver behavior outside Rust timing.

If `samples` is always `120`:

- That only means the log emitted after a full aggregation bucket.
- Check `callback_hz` on the main-loop line and `draw_hz` on the renderer line. On a 60 Hz device, a healthy continuous scroll should be near 60. Lower rates or large `sample_window_ms` indicate missed callback or draw opportunities even though the bucket still says `samples=120`.

## Physical Device Smoke Test

Use a physical Android device. Emulator numbers are not enough for this investigation.

```sh
./scripts/run-android.sh --target arm64-v8a
```

Clear frame stats:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo dev.zedra.app.debug reset
```

Test flow:

1. Start host daemon: `zedra start --workdir .`
2. Open the debug Android app and connect to a workspace.
3. Open a large markdown file from the drawer.
4. Scroll for 30 seconds, fling several times, then open a large source file and repeat in the code editor.
5. With each file visible behind it, drag the workspace drawer and switch drawer tabs.
6. Background and foreground the app.
7. Confirm rendering resumes without reconnecting.
8. Capture frame stats:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo dev.zedra.app.debug framestats
```

Expected:

- No per-touch, per-IME, per-key, per-fling, or per-inset log spam.
- Periodic `AndroidPerf` summaries during scroll or fling.
- Surface replacement logs show preserved renderer behavior after background/foreground.
- No sustained jank in `framestats` on the target physical device.

For release app id, use `dev.zedra.app` instead of `dev.zedra.app.debug`.

## Build Checks

Prefer targeted checks first:

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path vendor/zed/Cargo.toml -p gpui_android -p gpui_wgpu
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a check --manifest-path vendor/zed/Cargo.toml -p gpui_android
./scripts/build-android.sh --target=arm64-v8a
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The root workspace excludes `vendor/zed`, so vendored GPUI checks must use `vendor/zed/Cargo.toml`.

## Current Handoff State

The Android performance work was handed off into:

- root project: `/Users/thomasle/projects/zedra`
- vendored GPUI checkout: `/Users/thomasle/projects/zedra/vendor/zed`

The requested path `/Users/thomasle/projects/zedra/vendor/main` was not present on disk during handoff. Use `vendor/zed` unless a separate vendor worktree is created later.

At handoff time, the main checkout had:

- `docs/MANUAL_TEST.md` updated with `0c-Android-WGPU. Performance Smoke`
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/ffi.rs` updated with aggregated main-loop `AndroidPerf` logging
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/platform.rs` updated so `process_pending_tasks` returns a drained task count
- `vendor/zed/crates/gpui_wgpu/src/wgpu_renderer.rs` updated with surface cap logging and renderer acquire/draw `AndroidPerf` logging

The following checks passed in `/Users/thomasle/projects/zedra`:

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path vendor/zed/Cargo.toml -p gpui_android -p gpui_wgpu
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a check --manifest-path vendor/zed/Cargo.toml -p gpui_android
./scripts/build-android.sh --target=arm64-v8a
```

## Current Next Plan

### 2026-05-11 Editor Layout Cache Follow-Up

The row-ID probe showed `root_layout_without_id=0`, but
`root_layout_reused=0` remained. That is expected: `root_layout_reused` only
means the same `Drawable` was measured more than once before paint in one draw
cycle. Virtual-list rows are recreated each draw, so stable ids help
attribution but do not create cross-frame layout reuse.

Useful steady editor samples showed roughly:

- `root_prepaint_layout_ms`: about `8-10ms`
- `root_layout_samples`: about `57-87`
- `taffy_request_nodes`: about `329-511`
- `taffy_request_measured_nodes`: about `100-132`
- `taffy_measure_calls`: about `302-372`

Attempted and then reverted:

- `UniformList` no longer measures one item during `request_layout` when using
  default `ListSizingBehavior::Auto`; that size is unused there and the real
  item height is measured in prepaint.
- `StyledText` can accept a caller-owned `TextLayout` cache.
- Code editor and git diff cached lines now keep a stable `TextLayout` per
  cached line and reset those layouts when syntax/highlight runs change.
- stable ids on recreated editor and git-diff virtual rows.

Result:

- The cache attempt did increase `text_cache_hits` and reduced Android backend
  shaping in steady frames, but visible jank remained dominated by GPUI
  prepaint/layout and paint.
- The added row state and ids were not clearly beneficial, and may distort
  pure immediate rendering behavior.
- Keep this as a later app/framework-layout optimization track. It is not the
  active fix direction now.
- Steady `editor rows detail` logs are disabled so platform/backend runs are
  less perturbed by app-level row diagnostics.

1. Keep physical-device logs as the source of truth. The app-level markdown,
   editor, drawer, and debug benchmark views are repro surfaces, not the current
   fix boundary.
2. Treat synchronous tree-sitter query compilation during file open as fixed.
   If `editor set_content` regresses above low single-digit milliseconds, first
   check that it is still using `Highlighter::pending_for_filename(...)`.
3. Continue on platform/backend optimization first:
   - glyph raster and atlas miss behavior in `gpui_android`
   - WGPU/Vulkan encode, submit, finish, and present behavior in `gpui_wgpu`
   - Android-specific text backend stack costs after GPUI cache effects are
     separated out
4. Keep isolating Android backend costs with cached-scene/text-heavy
   benchmark views and renderer rows. Text/glyph raster, atlas upload,
   monochrome batching, and WGPU present/backpressure are still valid suspects.
5. Keep Android native glyph APIs as an API 31+ experiment, not the main fix for
   the current `minSdk 23` app.

### 2026-05-14 Drawer Tap Jank Follow-Up

The current clean repro is tapping the drawer toggle button repeatedly. The
first few tap-open animations can look smooth, while later taps can become
visibly worse; dragging the drawer is not the same repro.

Latest evidence from the filtered process logs:

- `AndroidPerf drawer toggle` is tiny, so the tap handler itself is not the
  bottleneck.
- `AndroidPerf animation frame` shows the visual snap mostly finishing near
  the expected duration, but frame gaps are irregular.
- `gpui draw_roots` and text/layout do not consistently grow in the later bad
  taps.
- Later bad frames correlate more with `renderer present_ms`,
  `gpui frame present_ms`, and SurfaceFlinger late/irregular presentation than
  with app-level drawer render cost.

Current probe:

- Kotlin Choreographer assigns a monotonic `frame_seq`.
- `gpui_android` stores that sequence in `gpui::mobile_perf` before processing
  the JNI frame callback.
- `gpui frame slow`, `gpui frame sample_row`, `renderer slow`, and
  `renderer sample_row` include the same sequence as `frame_seq` or
  `renderer_frame_seq`.
- Use this to correlate a single bad visual frame across
  Choreographer -> GPUI frame -> WGPU renderer, instead of aligning rows only by
  timestamp.

Frame-pacing A/B:

- `60/Fifo` showed large present/backpressure stalls and irregular
  SurfaceFlinger presentation.
- Forcing the SurfaceView frame-rate vote to `120` while keeping `Fifo`
  improved the worst stalls, but still left many `30-45ms` drawer-tap frames.
- Forcing `120/Mailbox` selected `Mailbox` successfully on the device, but did
  not improve this repro; renderer and GPUI present averages were worse than
  `120/Fifo`.

Next probe:

- `AndroidPerf main loop slow` logs the same `frame_seq` from the Rust JNI
  frame boundary, split into pending-task drain, fling processing, whole
  GPUI-frame request time, live window count, request callback count, and
  callback elapsed time.
- `AndroidPerf choreographer slow` also logs the idle gap since the previous
  callback ended and the previous callback duration. Use these fields to tell
  whether slow drawer-tap frames are caused by GPUI work inside the callback,
  Android compositor/present backpressure, or callback scheduling drift after a
  blocked frame.
- `AndroidPerf renderer slow` splits renderer pre-present cost into known
  phases and unaccounted time, plus per-`queue.write_buffer` uniform updates
  and gaps since the previous renderer draw/submit. Use this after tiny-scene
  drawer frames show `16ms+` renderer work with only a handful of batches.

Next manual run:

```sh
./scripts/android-render-capture.sh prepare
```

Then test only the drawer toggle tap repro for 15-20 taps and capture with:

```sh
./scripts/android-render-capture.sh pull
```

### 2026-05-14 Present Backpressure Probe

Correct adb repro:

```sh
adb shell input tap 500 1405 # open saved workspace from Home
adb shell input tap 900 600  # close the initially visible drawer if needed
adb logcat -c
adb shell input tap 56 158   # hamburger, not drawer home icon
sleep 0.65
adb shell input tap 900 600  # backdrop close
sleep 1.25
adb logcat -d -v threadtime | rg "AndroidPerf|drawer snap|draw_roots slow|window_draw slow|gpui frame slow|renderer slow|async_present|present_backpressure_skip|choreographer slow"
```

Important correction: when the drawer is already open, the same top-left
region is the drawer home icon and returns to Home. Always verify the drawer is
closed before treating `(56, 158)` as the hamburger.

Current device surface caps:

- adapter: `Mali-G68 MC4`
- backend: `Vulkan`
- supported present modes: `[Mailbox, Fifo]`
- `Immediate` and `FifoRelaxed` debug choices fall back to `Fifo` on this
  device.

Useful finding:

- Inline `Fifo` repeats UI-thread stalls because `SurfaceTexture::present()`
  commonly blocks for `16-30ms`.
- Offloading `present()` alone moves that stall into the next
  `get_current_texture()` acquire.
- Android now defaults to the offloaded present path. The Choreographer frame
  loop drains GPUI foreground tasks first, then skips only draw/acquire while an
  older async present is still pending. This keeps dirty work queued and avoids
  moving the same swapchain stall back onto the UI thread.

Latest offload-gated drawer sample:

- no `renderer slow` rows in the filtered drawer open/close capture
- no `draw_roots slow` rows in the same capture
- worst main-loop rows were around `16.8ms` and `18.2ms`, down from earlier
  `30-40ms` callback frames
- async present worker still reports `present_ms` around `8-13ms`, confirming
  the surface/compositor wait still exists but no longer dominates the UI
  callback

Interpretation:

- This is a real Android backend direction, not an app-level drawer fix:
  synchronous WGPU acquire/present on the Android UI thread is the largest
  repeated stall in this repro.
- The offload gate is the current minimal backend fix. It reduces UI-thread
  blocking, but the durable architecture should still move Android GPUI
  rendering/presentation to a dedicated render/runtime thread or equivalent
  backend scheduler so UI events, GPUI foreground tasks, and swapchain waits
  cannot block each other.

## 2026-05-14 draw_roots Cost, Instrumentation A/B, iOS Comparison, Cache Defeat

This session continued the drawer-tap repro on a physical device (Mali-G68,
120Hz, `dev.zedra.app.debug`). It confirmed the offload-present fix works,
isolated the remaining cost, ruled out instrumentation self-inflation, compared
against iOS, and found why the existing view caching does not engage.

### Offload present: confirmed working

Drawer-tap repro (15 open/close): zero `renderer slow` rows. `renderer
async_present` runs on a worker thread (`present_ms` 9-14ms, off the UI
thread). `present_backpressure_skip` gate is active. The UI-thread stall is no
longer the synchronous present.

### Remaining cost is GPUI `draw_roots`, not the backend

Drawer-tap slow frames: `window_draw slow total_ms` 21-27ms, almost entirely in
`draw_roots_ms`. Decomposition (terminal-heavy scene, ~660 scene items):

- prepaint dominates: `root_layout_request` 3.5-5.7ms, `deferred_layout_request`
  2.3-3.4ms, `element_prepaint` 3-5ms. `layout_request` (the recursive
  request-layout walk plus Taffy node construction) beats `layout_compute`
  (Taffy solve, 0.4-0.6ms) by ~8-10x.
- paint: `root_paint` 5-10ms, `deferred_paint` 1.4-2.5ms.
- not the cost: Taffy solve, text layout (<1ms), Android text backend (0ms),
  glyph raster (0 atlas misses — codex's text caching holds), renderer, present.
- top exclusive contributor in `request_layout_exclusive` is
  `gpui::view::AnyView` — 10 calls, 2.7-4.9ms exclusive.

### Instrumentation is not inflating the numbers

Added a runtime gate `gpui::set_instrumentation_enabled` /
`instrumentation_enabled` in `gpui::mobile_perf`, wired through
`setDebugInstrumentation` JNI -> `GpuiRuntimeController` -> `DebugRenderPacing`
-> `scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --instrumentation on|off`. It early-returns
every `record_*` sink in `mobile_perf` (12 fns) and `crates/zedra/src/
android_perf.rs` (17 fns), removing the `Mutex`/aggregation/per-source
attribution and the per-anim-frame `info!` calls.

A/B over the same repro: instrumentation on vs off moved the slow-frame
`request_callback_ms` by ~0.7-1.3ms (within run-to-run noise); only the max tail
shrank (48ms -> 39ms). Verdict: the 16-22ms `draw_roots` cost is real GPUI work.
The toggle defaults on and is a reusable A/B tool; it is not gated by a build
feature so the inline `Instant::now()` pairs still run, but call-count math
bounds those well under 1ms/frame.

### iOS comparison (IosPerf, same terminal-heavy scene)

iOS log capture required two fixes: `crates/zedra/src/ios/logger.rs` now also
writes to stderr (idevicesyslog cannot decode the app dylib's os_log on recent
iOS; `devicectl device process launch --console` captures stderr cleanly), and
`gpui::mobile_perf::android_frame_sequence` is now available on iOS (returns 0)
so `gpui` compiles for `aarch64-apple-ios` — three unconditional call sites in
`window.rs` were previously android-only and broke the iOS build.

Findings:

- iOS `draw_roots` is NOT cheap on the same scene — it also hits 17-18ms.
- The difference is frequency: iOS produced ~5 slow rows in 15 taps (mostly
  transitional: home view, cold first-paint, cold text); Android produced ~13+,
  all steady drawer-anim frames. iOS steady frames mostly stay under threshold.
- Per phase, Android pays a broad ~1.5-2x tax (`layout_request`,
  `element_prepaint`, `paint` all ~2x) — a uniform per-operation cost, not one
  hot path. It is NOT an optimization gap: `gpui` is already `opt-level = 3` in
  the root dev profile.
- iOS has its own different slow spots: `gpui frame slow` is `present_ms`
  12-18ms (Metal present); `terminal_card.rs` `deferred_paint` 7-9ms.
- Reframe: the `cx.notify`-per-frame full-redraw pattern costs ~17ms on both
  platforms for this scene. iOS is over budget less often. Reducing `draw_roots`
  cost helps both.

### Why the existing `.cached()` view caching does not engage

`DrawerHost::new` already wraps `content` and `drawer` in `AnyView::cached(...)`
(`drawer_host.rs:113-114`). The Android `draw_roots` still re-renders
`workspace.rs:2602` (`WorkspaceContent::render`) every animation frame, so the
cache misses every frame. A device probe in the cached-view prepaint path
(`gpui/src/view.rs`) and in `Window::refresh` logged the reason:

- 60-74% of misses have `window.refreshing == true` as the ONLY failing
  condition (bounds/content_mask/text_style/dirty all match).
- `window.refreshing` is set by `window.refresh()`. The dominant caller is
  GPUI's built-in `:active` press feedback: `div.rs:3227` (pointer up) and
  `div.rs:3288` (pointer down) call `window.refresh()` for any pressable div.
  Each drawer-toggle tap therefore fires a full-window `refresh()` on pointer
  down and up, which sets `refreshing = true` and forces every `.cached()` view
  to miss that draw. ~100+ `refresh()` calls per 20 toggles.
- `window.rs:4956` also calls `window.refresh()` whenever `force_render` is set
  (comment scopes it to GPU device recovery, but it fires for generic forced
  frames too).
- The right-side "Workspaces" drawer's panel content cannot be cached at all:
  it lives inside the sliding panel, so its `bounds`/`content_mask` change every
  frame (`bounds_ok=false mask_ok=false` misses). Only the left drawer's
  fixed-position workspace `content` can benefit from caching.

`drawer snap` logic itself is clean: stable 100/160ms durations, every `start`
has a matching `done`, generation counter increments cleanly. Repeated-tap
degradation ("later opens jankier") was not cleanly reproduced as monotonic
growth in automated taps (`main loop slow` is noisy 17-36ms with one 36ms
spike); it likely needs a frame-interval/pacing capture or is compositor-side.

### To make caching actually work (not yet done)

- Change GPUI's `:active` press feedback (`div.rs:3227/3288`) from a full
  `window.refresh()` to a targeted invalidation of the affected view, and
  decouple `force_render` from cache-bypass (`window.rs:4956`). Both are core
  GPUI changes affecting every pressable div / forced frame app-wide.
- Even fixed, only the left drawer's fixed-bounds `content` benefits; the right
  drawer's sliding panel content needs a different approach (snapshot, or cache
  the panel content at a stable local origin and translate the container).

### Instrumentation currently in the tree (uncommitted)

Kept: the `set_instrumentation_enabled` toggle (gpui `mobile_perf` + gpui_android
JNI + Kotlin `DebugRenderPacing` + `android-render-pacing.sh`); the iOS
`android_frame_sequence` build fix; the iOS `logger.rs` stderr write;
`nslog_bridge.m` reverted to `%s`. Removed: the ad-hoc `cached_view miss` probe
in `view.rs` and the `window_refresh caller` probe in `window.rs` (findings
captured above).

Known unrelated bug: `scripts/run-ios.sh` installs from a stale DerivedData
path; the build succeeds but install fails with "not a valid bundle" — worked
around by installing the freshest `Zedra.app` manually.

## 2026-05-15 Cleanup Checkpoint, Feature-Gated Re-Introduction Plan

Decision to reset the Android-backend track to a clean baseline before
re-introducing each win behind its own Cargo feature so we can measure each
change against upstream. The full investigation (offload-present, atlas
oldest-first, batch caching, FreeType A/B, swash handoff cache, debug pacing
controls, instrumentation toggle, iOS comparison, `:active`-defeats-cache
finding) is recorded in the dated sections above and remains the source of
truth for what to re-implement.

### What now lives in the tree

Vendor/Zed (`vendor/zed`):

- `crates/gpui_wgpu/Cargo.toml` — single experimental feature
  `atlas-oldest-first` declared (off by default).
- `crates/gpui_wgpu/src/wgpu_atlas.rs` — `atlas-oldest-first` is implemented:
  on Android + monochrome, the allocator scans textures oldest→newest so common
  glyphs stay in the primary atlas, and the default mono atlas size is bumped
  to 2048×2048. Both changes are gated by
  `#[cfg(all(target_os = "android", feature = "atlas-oldest-first"))]`.
- `crates/gpui_android/Cargo.toml` — pass-through feature
  `atlas-oldest-first = ["gpui_wgpu/atlas-oldest-first"]`.

Everything else under `vendor/zed` is at upstream HEAD. The diagnostic
instrumentation that was added during the investigation (`mobile_perf` module,
per-element/draw/text/glyph `AndroidPerf`/`IosPerf` hooks, sample structures,
slow-row logging) is gone.

Root (`zedra`):

- `Cargo.toml` — `[profile.dev.package]` keeps hot crates optimised
  (`gpui`/`gpui_android`/`gpui_wgpu`/`taffy`/`cosmic-text`/`swash`/`fontdb`/
  `harfrust`/`rustybuzz`/`skrifa`/`ttf-parser`/`unicode-*`/`yazi`/`zeno`).
  Real measured Android benefit; kept.

Everything else under the zedra app is at HEAD. The app-level perf hooks,
benchmark views, `HostInfoState` split, drawer `.cached()` experiment, and the
syntax-highlighter cache rework are gone.

Tooling kept on disk but currently dormant (untracked):

- `scripts/android-{render-pacing,render-capture,perf-summary}.{sh,py}` —
  designed to drive debug pacing broadcasts and parse `AndroidPerf` log
  buckets. With instrumentation removed and `DebugRenderPacingReceiver`
  deleted, the broadcasts now have no receiver and the parser has no input.
  Kept so the interface is documented; will be re-wired alongside the
  re-introduced features.
- `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` — release-build artifact, left in place.

### What is intentionally deferred for the next session

The following wins were validated during the investigation but are not yet
re-introduced under feature flags. Each is its own self-contained piece of
work, planned as a separate commit:

1. **`offload-present`** — async WGPU `SurfaceTexture::present()` worker plus
   `android_pending_async_presents_for_frame_skip` API. Belongs in
   `gpui_wgpu/src/wgpu_renderer.rs` with a consumer in
   `gpui_android/src/android/ffi.rs` (`process_android_frame` skip-while-pending
   check). Confirmed working in the prior captures — biggest single backend
   win.
2. **`batch-bind-group-cache`** — shared instance bind group with `first_instance`
   offsets, plus consecutive mono text batches keep pipeline/globals bound.
   Reduced encode time from ~6.8 ms (max 24 ms) avg to ~1.4 ms (max 5.8 ms)
   in the 2026-05-10 capture.
3. **Choreographer driver with debug pacing controls** — `gpui_android`
   `GpuiRuntimeController` Choreographer-driven `gpuiRequestFrame(frameSeq)`,
   `setDebugPresentMode/Strategy/MaxFrameLatency/FrameDriverMode`, and the
   matching JNI exports + `set_debug_*_override` setters in
   `gpui_android::android::window`. With this comes the
   `DebugRenderPacingReceiver.kt` broadcast wiring, manifest entry, and the
   `scripts/android-render-pacing.sh --frame-rate/--present-mode/...`
   interface for runtime A/B.
4. **FreeType A/B rasterizer + swash handoff cache** — `gpui_android`
   text_system path that uses FreeType for grayscale non-emoji glyphs and a
   bounded same-params swash image handoff cache to remove the duplicate
   render on atlas miss. Likely behind a feature too (TBD).
5. **`AndroidFrameRequestStats` return + sheet glue** — `request_frame_*`
   returning `{ live_windows, callbacks }`, `process_pending_tasks → usize`,
   and the `Java_dev_zedra_app_SheetHostView_nativeSheetProcessSurfaceCommands`
   JNI in `crates/zedra/src/android/jni.rs` that drains tasks + forces a
   frame when a sheet surface is created.

Each will get a small feature-gated commit, default off, A/B-testable via
`cargo ndk ... --features gpui_android/<name>`.

### Known active findings to address with the re-introduction

When `offload-present` lands again it must keep the present-backpressure-skip
gate that was confirmed to remove the UI-thread present stall. Independent of
that, the dated 2026-05-14 entry above ("Cache Defeat") documents the more
fundamental finding that GPUI's built-in `:active` press feedback in
`div.rs:3227/3288` calls full `window.refresh()` on every pointer down/up,
which sets `window.refreshing = true` and defeats every `.cached()` view in
the same draw. That is a separate upstream `gpui` change and intentionally
not part of the Android-backend track being re-introduced here; it is filed
for a future investigation.

## 2026-05-15 — PerDebug Drill-Down: GPU Is The Bottleneck

Fresh investigation from zero, instrumented via the new `perdebug` feature
on `gpui` + `gpui_wgpu` + `gpui_android` (off by default; see
`docs/GPUI_ANDROID_PROGRESS.md` for build flag). Repro: right-drawer
toggle (`quick-action-btn`) on workspace, 20 taps at 0.5s pace via
`scripts/devtool.sh`, aggregated with `scripts/android-perf-debug.py`.

Hardware: Mali-G68 MC4, 1080×2400 @ 120 Hz, Mailbox present mode confirmed
at surface init (caps include Mailbox + Fifo).

### Per-frame budget (terminal main, right drawer toggle, n=151)

```
PHASE              p50      p95      max
draw_roots         5.35    15.08    58.82    ← CPU prep (gpui)

present           37.32    62.40    65.11    ← Window::present total
```

### Headline numbers

- **`gpu_pass` p50 = 29.6 ms.** Mali-G68 takes ~30 ms of pure GPU time per
  frame for ~15 batches on a 1080×2400 surface. That's the bottleneck.
- CPU side total (encode + finish + submit) = ~4 ms. Fine.
- Sync wait was added (`device.poll(PollType::wait_indefinitely())`) before
  reading timestamp buffer; that stalls the main thread on GPU completion
  and absorbs the back-pressure that was previously billed to
  `wgpu_present`. Without the wait, prior runs showed `wgpu_present` p95
  = 19 ms / max = 33 ms — same underlying cost, just measured in a
  different column.
- Present mode = `Mailbox`. Not a vsync (Fifo) block.

### Why "Android backend" not "general perf"

CPU prep is comparable to iOS. CPU encode is single-digit ms. Submit and
finish are sub-ms. The Mali-G68 GPU itself is the slow path — 3D game
engines push complex scenes through the same class of device in single-digit
ms. **It is not raw GPU power; it is how `gpui_wgpu` constructs and issues
work to wgpu/Vulkan on Mali.** Hypotheses to confirm next:

1. **Render-pass count.** Mali is TBDR. Every `begin_render_pass` is a tile
   buffer roundtrip. Path/shadow rendering opens `main_pass_continued`
   passes per batch. If a frame has 3-5 passes, that alone could explain
   ~half the cost.
2. **Per-batch GPU time.** With `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES` (supported
   on Mali-G68 per `PerDebug adapter_features`), each batch type can be
   timed in isolation. Identifies which pipeline is heavy (subpixel text
   uses dual-source blending, which is expensive on Mali).
3. **Texture switches inside a pass.** Each atlas bind in the loop forces
   a tile flush on TBDR.
4. **`desired_maximum_frame_latency = 2` + Mailbox.** Standard, but worth
   confirming it isn't interacting badly with the Mali compositor.
5. **Bind group churn.** Currently 15 `create_bind_group` per frame; cheap
   per call (~120 µs each), total ~1.8 ms. Not the bottleneck here.

### What this rules out

- Not CPU prep (`draw_roots` 5.4 ms p50).
- Not bind-group count (15/frame).
- Not batch count (15/frame).
- Not encoder finalize (0.8 ms).
- Not Vulkan submit (0.6 ms).
- Not vsync — Mailbox confirmed.
- Not text-event amplification on TerminalView (it renders only 30% of
  frames; spikes track GPU, not view re-renders).
- Not cache defeat at the gpui level for this repro — `views=7-8`,
  `hits=0`, `misses=0` per frame; no `.cached()` views to defeat.
  Caching might still help by avoiding repeated paint work, but the
  current floor is GPU-bound, so it would not move the headline number.

### Next steps queued

- Add render-pass counter (single atomic, increment at each
  `begin_render_pass` in `wgpu_renderer.rs`). Log per frame.
- Add per-batch GPU timestamp queries using a larger `QuerySet` and
  `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES`, resolved into a frame-sized ring
  buffer + read back next frame so the sync stall can be dropped.
- Subagent dispatched to research Mali/Adreno tuning best practices for
  wgpu-based 2D UI renderers (TBDR-friendly pass layout, texture
  binding cadence, instance buffer strategy, present-mode interaction
  with the Android compositor). Findings filed back here.

### Pass-count measurement landed

Added `WGPU_PASS_COUNT` atomic, incremented at every `begin_render_pass`
call site (`main_pass`, `main_pass_continued`, `path_rasterization_pass`).
Emitted on `PerDebug phase=wgpu_counts`. Result for the drawer-toggle repro:

```
passes  per frame = 1   (every frame)
batches per frame = 15
```

**Single render pass.** No `main_pass_continued` triggered (no path/shadow
batches in this scene), so TBR pass-split is **not** the bottleneck here.
The 30+ ms `gpu_pass` cost is all inside one main pass.

### Research subagent landed — `docs/RESEARCH_MALI_WGPU.md`

Top finding flips the picture:

> **`PresentMode::Mailbox` on wgpu/Vulkan is uncapped (wgpu#2128).** With
> `desired_maximum_frame_latency = 2`, the GPU timestamp-measured
> `gpu_pass` ≈ 30–45 ms may largely be pipeline depth / back-pressure,
> not single-frame GPU work.

Other actionable items from the research, ordered by leverage:

1. **Switch to `Fifo` + triple-buffer, re-measure first.** Cheap A/B; may
   move the headline number a lot before any code change.
2. **Per-batch `create_bind_group` is a Mali hot path** — Khronos cites
   38% frame-time reduction from descriptor caching. Our measurement
   shows ~2.4 ms/frame in `create_bg_ms` so the win is modest unless the
   actual GPU-time cost (descriptor heap traffic on Mali) is being
   under-counted by CPU timing.
3. **Drop subpixel AA on Android** — at 400+ dpi grayscale is visually
   equivalent (iOS never had it; Apple disabled system-wide in 2018).
   Removes the dual-source blending pipeline, eliminates pipeline switch
   per text batch, and gives Mali Valhall its fixed-function blender path.
4. **Path/MSAA attachment hygiene** — MSAA color should be
   `StoreOp::DontCare`; the intermediate texture should be
   `RENDER_ATTACHMENT`-only (so wgpu/Mali can map it transient/lazy).
5. **One `write_buffer` per frame** for instance data + pipeline-first
   batch sort so consecutive same-pipeline batches keep state.
6. **Vello Hybrid / Slint / Makepad** all converged on "one pass, one
   pipeline, one buffer write per frame" specifically to make Mali
   numbers comparable to Adreno.
7. **Timestamp caveat:** Mali `timestampPeriod` is ~52 ns;
   `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES` writes hit `BOTTOM_OF_PIPE`, not draw
   boundaries. Per-batch attribution needs ARM Streamline counters
   (external read bandwidth vs shader cycles) for confirmation.

### Next test queued

Add a `present-fifo` build flag that swaps Android `preferred_present_mode`
from `Mailbox` to `Fifo` at compile time, rebuild, re-run the same
drawer-toggle repro. Compare `gpu_pass` p50/p95. If it drops a lot →
Mailbox+frame_latency interaction was inflating the GPU timestamp; the
underlying renderer is fine. If unchanged → real GPU work; proceed to
per-batch timestamps to find which pipeline dominates.

### Fifo A/B result (same repro, n≈100 each)

```
                 Mailbox     Fifo        Δ
gpu_pass p50     45.75       32.81       -28%
gpu_pass p95     53.98       53.34       ~same
gpu_pass max     55.69       53.52       ~same
present  p50     55.14       46.47       -16%
present  p95     66.53       67.14       ~same
```

**Mixed result.** Fifo trims 13 ms off the median `gpu_pass`, confirming
Mailbox+`frame_latency=2` was inflating the typical-frame number by adding
pipeline depth. But the p95/max ceiling stays at ~53 ms in both modes,
which is *not* explained by present-mode interaction. That ceiling is the
real frontier.

What 53 ms cannot easily be:

- Vsync — Fifo would lock to 8.33 ms (120 Hz) or 16.67 ms (60 Hz), neither
  matches 53.
- Pipeline depth — Fifo with `frame_latency=2` would max ~33 ms; 53 ms is
  beyond two-frame depth.
- Single full-screen pass overdraw — only 15 batches, all 4-vertex
  instanced quads, single pass.

What it likely is:

- The Mali timestamp semantics: `RenderPassTimestampWrites` writes at
  `TOP_OF_PIPE` (begin) and `BOTTOM_OF_PIPE` (end). With deferred TBR
  scheduling, "begin" may stamp before any per-tile work has started, and
  "end" stamps only after the last tile has been resolved. The reported
  `gpu_pass` is the *frontier-to-resolve* span, not the wall-clock work
  spent on this frame's commands.
- Mali's job-chaining: if a prior submit is still in-flight, the new
  submit's first vertex shader may not start until the prior render's
  tile-buffer flush completes. That delay shows up inside our begin/end
  window.

The earlier 2-3 ms iOS Metal comparison is fair for CPU-side prep but
not directly for the timestamp ceiling, since iOS uses `MTLCommandBuffer
GPUStartTime`/`GPUEndTime` instead of in-pass write_timestamp.

### Next narrows queued

1. ~~Lower `desired_maximum_frame_latency` from 2 → 1, rebuild, re-measure
   Fifo.~~ **Done.** Result: p50 keeps dropping with each latency
   reduction (Mailbox+L2 45.75 → Fifo+L2 32.81 → Fifo+L1 24.28), but the
   p95 ceiling stays pinned at ~53 ms in every config. Conclusion: the
   ceiling is **real per-frame GPU work** on heavy frames inside the
   single main pass, not pipeline depth or vsync. Present-mode tuning is
   not going to remove it. Need per-batch timestamps next.
2. Apply the `batch-bind-group-cache` re-introduction earlier than the
   queued plan said — Khronos cites 38% Mali frame-time reduction from
   exactly this change. Cheap to implement, well-bounded.
3. Switch the Android subpixel sprite pipeline to grayscale-only
   (research #4) and measure.
4. ~~Per-batch timestamp queries with `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES`.~~
   **Done — does not work on Mali.** Expanded `QuerySet` to 256 entries,
   wired `pass.write_timestamp` around every batch in the loop, resolved
   into a 2 KB map buffer, parsed back per-batch deltas. **Every batch
   reports 0.00 ms.** Confirms the research caveat: on Mali Valhall, in-
   pass `write_timestamp` writes at `BOTTOM_OF_PIPE` after the entire
   pass tile-rasterizes. The vertex-side draw commands queue almost
   instantaneously, so the deltas between consecutive in-pass timestamps
   are all near zero. The total `gpu_pass` (from
   `RenderPassTimestampWrites` begin/end) remains correct because that
   captures the full tile-rasterize span. Per-batch attribution via
   write_timestamp is a dead end on this hardware.

### What still works for attribution

- **Per-pipeline A/B**: feature-gated skips of one pipeline at a time
  (skip `mono_sprites`, or skip `subpixel_sprites`, etc.) and re-measure
  `gpu_pass`. The drop tells you that pipeline's GPU cost.
- **Per-pipeline instance counts** logged per frame: gives us how much
  fragment-work each pipeline is asking for. Combined with the gpu_pass
  delta from skips, lets us derive cost-per-instance per pipeline.
- **External: ARM Performance Studio / Streamline** for `external_read`
  bandwidth and shader cycle counters, which are accurate per-batch on
  Mali. Adds a tool dependency but is the canonical way.

Next iteration: add per-batch instance count logging (one cheap counter
per primitive kind), then a feature-gated `skip-subpixel-sprites` build
flag and run the same drawer-toggle repro both ways.

### Pipeline-skip A/B and per-kind instance counts (2026-05-15 cont'd)

Added six feature flags (`skip-quads`, `skip-mono-sprites`,
`skip-poly-sprites`, `skip-subpixel-sprites`, `skip-shadows`,
`skip-underlines`) that compile out the matching arm of the batch
dispatch in `wgpu_renderer.rs`. Re-ran the same Fifo + `frame-latency=1`
drawer-toggle repro for each. Result:

```
config                            gpu_pass p50    p95    max
baseline                          24.28           53.34  55.37
skip-mono-sprites                 18.71           41.33  45.70
skip-poly-sprites                 42.96 *         53.34  53.79
skip-quads                         1.00            1.28   1.41
```

* `skip-poly-sprites` p50 went *up*, almost certainly sample-size noise
(n=92 vs n=251 — fewer frames captured, mix dominated by steady-state
not animation). The ceiling stayed at 53. Poly is **not** the culprit.

**Quads alone are ≥95 % of Mali GPU pass time.** Removing every other
primitive type leaves the ceiling untouched. Removing quads drops the
entire `gpu_pass` to **1 ms**.

Scene primitive counts (logged via new `PerDebug scene` line):

```
quads=16   rounded=5   bordered=5
mono_sprites=156   subpixel=0   poly=0
shadows=0   underlines=0   paths=0
```

Sixteen quads is small. But each one is potentially full-screen-sized
(workspace bg, drawer-host bg, terminal-view bg, drawer-panel bg, plus
inset rectangles). 11 of 16 hit the fast path in `fs_quad` (no rounding,
no border); 5 take the SDF slow path. The cost is not the SDF math —
it's the overdraw.

### The quad-overdraw hypothesis

Math: 1080 × 2400 = 2.6 M pixels. If ~5–10 of the 16 quads cover the
full surface, that is 13 M – 26 M fragments per frame *for quads alone*.
Mali-G68's fragment rate for alpha-blended shading is ~1 G fragments/s.
**13–26 M frags ÷ 1 G/s = 13–26 ms.** That matches our `gpu_pass`
exactly, including the p95 of ~53 ms during heavier animation frames
where more layers are visible during the drawer slide.

The reason Mali pays per-layer for these quads:
- The quad pipeline has `ColorTargetState` with `blend = Some(...)` set
  unconditionally (`gpui_wgpu/src/wgpu_pipelines.rs` quads pipeline) so
  it can support rounded corners + borders blending against the
  background. Blend-enabled disables Mali's **early-Z hidden-surface
  removal** at the per-fragment level (Mali FPK; see ARM "Killing
  Pixels" doc). Every overdraw layer pays full fragment-shader cost
  even when later layers will overwrite it.
- iOS/Apple GPUs are *immediate-mode tilers* with on-chip color buffer.
  They handle UI overdraw at near-zero cost via tile memory residency.
  Mali pays main-memory bandwidth on each load/store when overdraw
  forces multiple read-modify-write cycles per tile.
- Even the 11 fast-path quads still cost full fragment shading because
  the pipeline cannot opt out of blending per draw call without a
  separate pipeline.

### Where the win lives next

1. **Split the quad pipeline into opaque-only and blended variants.**
   Quads with `background.alpha == 1.0`, no border, no rounded corners
   should go through a pipeline with `blend = None` so Mali can apply
   early-Z and skip overdraw. The classifier already exists in shape
   (`unrounded`/`fast path` in `fs_quad`); just push it to pipeline
   selection time.
2. **Front-to-back sort of opaque quads** so early-Z does maximum work.
   gpui currently draws back-to-front (painter's algorithm). The opaque
   pipeline can flip to front-to-back without visible difference.
3. **Cull occluded full-surface quads** before submitting. If
   `quad[i].covers_quad[i-1]` and both are opaque, skip the earlier one
   entirely.
4. **Reduce stacked full-screen backgrounds.** `WorkspaceContent`,
   `DrawerHost`, `TerminalView`, etc. each paint their own full-frame
   background. They should collapse to one base layer.

This is the live, surface-level architectural change implied by the
Bevy-research finding "Filament docs are not about pass minimization
for UI — the relevant Mali optimization is `LoadOp::Clear` + blend-off
on the bottom layer." We already do `LoadOp::Clear`; the missing half
is blend-off on the opaque-bottom-layer quad pipeline.

The full data + the Bevy/Filament research are filed at
`docs/RESEARCH_MALI_WGPU.md` and `docs/RESEARCH_BEVY_ANDROID_WGPU.md`.

### Opaque-quads-pipeline landed (2026-05-15 cont'd)

Implemented behind the new `opaque-quads-pipeline` feature
(`gpui_wgpu` → `gpui_android` → `zedra`, plus
`scripts/build-android.sh --opaque-quads-pipeline`). Adds a second
quad pipeline (`quads_opaque`) with `blend = None`. Same shader, same
vertex/fragment entry points. At draw time `draw_quads` walks the slice,
classifies each quad as opaque (no rounded corners, no border,
`background.as_solid().a >= 1.0`), groups into runs, then issues one
`pass.draw(0..4, run_start..run_end)` per run with the matching
pipeline. Single instance-buffer write per batch; single bind group.

Result, same Fifo + `frame-latency=1` drawer-toggle repro:

```
                  baseline    opaque-quads    Δ
gpu_pass p50      24.28       18.55           -24 %
gpu_pass p95     *53.34*      19.55           -63 %
gpu_pass max      55.37       19.79           -64 %
present  p50      43.54       28.75           -34 %
present  p95      63.83       31.77           -50 %
```

The 53 ms ceiling collapsed. p95 and max are now within ~1 ms of the
median, which is the signature of Mali's HSR (forward pixel kill)
actually working: opaque quads later in the painter's order are kicking
out earlier covered fragments, so the heavy-frame overdraw cost
disappears.

Visual correctness:
- `ALPHA_BLENDING` with `src.a = 1` reduces to `dst.rgb = src.rgb`,
  identical to `blend = None` replace.
- `PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA_BLENDING` with `src.a = 1` reduces to
  `dst.rgb = src.rgb`. Same.
- Quads that fail the opaque qualifier (rounded, bordered, or
  non-solid/transparent background) still route through the original
  blended pipeline.
- Run-length grouping means painter's order within a quad batch is
  preserved; we only switch pipelines at class transitions.
- Sanity check via devtool: scene elements still listed and laid out
  identically after the switch.

What is still owed:
- Manual visual diff across a wider set of UI surfaces (home view,
  workspace drawer animation, sheet host) before this can ship default-
  on. Currently feature-gated.
- The `present` numbers (28-32 ms) are still well over the 8.3 ms
  120 Hz budget; the new floor is CPU prep + driver overhead, not GPU
  fragment work. That's where the next round of tuning goes (the
  Bevy/Filament research already pointed at bind-group caching and
  swapchain pacing as the next levers).
- Extend the opaque classifier to also recognise fully-opaque linear
  gradients (both stops `a >= 1`) and the pattern backgrounds where
  applicable. Today only solid-with-`a >= 1` qualifies.

### Iterating further: extend is_opaque + skip transparent

Two follow-ups landed:

1. **`Background::is_opaque()` accessor in `gpui::color`.** Returns true
   when every fragment of the background is guaranteed alpha 1 (solid
   with `a >= 1`, or linear gradient with both stops `a >= 1`). Patterns
   never qualify. Renderer's quad classifier now uses this, so
   fully-opaque gradients also route through the no-blend pipeline.
2. **`skip-transparent-quads` feature.** Filters out quads whose
   background `is_transparent()` *before* the draw call. They produce no
   visible pixels but each one still shades a full screen-rect on Mali.

Repro numbers, same Fifo + `frame-latency=1`:

```
                  baseline   +opaque-quads   +skip-transparent
gpu_pass p50      24.28      18.55           10.53            -57 %

```

p50 now in the 60 Hz envelope (16.67 ms). p95 still touches the 60 Hz
budget but no longer blows past it. 120 Hz still requires ~30 % more
compression somewhere downstream.

Scene log on a representative steady frame after both flags on:

```
quads=5  rounded=1  bordered=1  opaque=2  translucent=2  min_alpha=0
```

The cost split that remains:

- **Opaque quads:** ~2 per frame, Mali HSR working — overdraw collapsed.
- **Translucent quads:** ~2 per frame routed through the blended
  pipeline. Each is a full-screen-sized layer at roughly half alpha;
  Mali pays full shading for these. These are the workspace UI elements
  that intentionally use translucency (drawer scrim, status surfaces).
- **Rounded/bordered quads:** 1-5 per frame, small areas (buttons,
  drawer chrome). Fragment cost is the SDF slow path but the bounding
  rects are tiny, so total cost is modest.
- **Mono sprites:** 70-440 glyphs per frame, every glyph is alpha-blended
  for AA. Mali pays per-fragment for every glyph.

### Where the next millisecond comes from

In rough priority of leverage:

1. **`LoadOp::Clear` to the workspace base color** instead of
   `LoadOp::Clear(TRANSPARENT)` followed by a full-screen bottom quad.
   Mali sets every tile pixel during tile init at near-zero cost —
   so removing the bottom-layer quad from the draw call entirely is
   pure win. Needs scene::finish to identify the bottom-most opaque
   quad covering the surface and convert it into the clear value.
2. **Audit the translucent backgrounds.** Drawer scrim and any
   `opacity: 0.95` rectangles are paying full Mali fragment cost for a
   subtle visual effect. Either make them fully opaque (with a colour
   already mixed for the intended effect) or move them to a single
   compositor-driven layer.
3. **Cull occluded full-surface quads.** If quad N+1 has the same
   bounds and is fully opaque, quad N can be dropped at scene level
   without going through Mali HSR at all.
4. **Bind-group caching** (still queued from research). 2.4 ms CPU
   per frame in `create_bg`; descriptor-heap traffic on Mali is
   measurable beyond the CPU number.
5. **Mono-sprite throughput.** With HSR doing nothing for alpha-blended
   glyphs, the cost scales with visible glyph count. Optimisations
   live in atlas packing density (more glyphs per atlas → fewer
   pipeline-state hazards) and glyph subpixel-positioning cost.

### `clear-bottom-quad` landed but mostly redundant

Implemented the bottom-quad-to-LoadOp::Clear collapse behind a third
feature flag. Logic in `wgpu_renderer.rs`:

1. Before begin_render_pass, scan `scene.quads` for the lowest-order
   quad with `as_solid().a >= 1`, no rounded corners, no border, and
   bounds that fully cover the surface.
2. If found, capture its `DrawOrder` and Hsla → `wgpu::Color`.
3. Use that color as the main_pass `LoadOp::Clear` argument.
4. In `draw_quads`, filter out the candidate by `DrawOrder` so it isn't
   drawn again.

Candidate is consistently identified for the workspace repro
(`PerDebug clear_base order=1 alpha=1.000 hsl=(0.000,0.077,0.051)` —
near-black workspace base). But the perf needle barely moves:

```
                  +opaque + skip-transparent   + clear-bottom-quad
gpu_pass p50      10.53                         11.10  (~noise)
gpu_pass p95      16.63                         16.19  (~noise)
present  p50      17.32                         22.56  (+30 % — see note)
```

The p50 sits in the same band. Mali HSR was *already* killing this
bottom quad as soon as the opaque-quad pipeline was on, so
collapsing it into `LoadOp::Clear` is duplicative. The
`present` regression looks like a different test-run's compositor
state, not the feature; subsequent runs returned to ~17 ms p50.

Conclusion: the feature is correct and shouldn't hurt, but it is
**not load-bearing** with `opaque-quads-pipeline` on. Worth keeping
gated for environments where HSR is less aggressive than Mali Valhall
(older Mali Bifrost, lower-tier Adreno) where explicit clear can still
beat the GPU.

### Final cumulative numbers (Fifo + frame-latency=1 + all three quad flags)

```
                  baseline        all flags on        Δ
gpu_pass p50      24.28           10.5 – 11.1         -55 % … -57 %
gpu_pass p95      53.34           16.2 – 16.6         -69 %
gpu_pass max      55.37           16.3 – 17.5         -68 %
present  p50      43.54           17.3 – 19.5         -55 % … -60 %
present  p95      63.83           24.0 – 25.5         -60 % … -62 %
```

60 Hz envelope reached at the median. p95 still at the 60 Hz boundary
but no longer past it. 120 Hz (~8.3 ms gpu_pass budget, ~5 ms allowing
for compositor) still needs another ~30 % compression. The remaining
cost is concentrated in:

- 2 full-screen translucent (gradient or sub-1.0-alpha) quads that
  still route through the blended pipeline — pure overdraw cost for a
  subtle visual effect.
- ~400 mono-sprite glyphs per frame, all alpha-blended.

Next concrete moves to push toward 120 Hz, each independently testable:

1. **Audit which app surfaces produce translucent full-screen quads.**
   `WorkspaceContent`, `DrawerHost`, the drawer scrim, status bars.
   Replace any "background + 0.95 alpha" surfaces with the pre-mixed
   opaque color so they qualify for the no-blend pipeline.
2. **Extend the opaque classifier for almost-rounded quads.** Small
   corner radius (≤ 8 px) on a large quad means the SDF blend only
   affects a tiny rim. Could split the quad into an opaque inner rect
   + a thin blended border ring at scene-finalize time.
3. **Glyph-batch sort by atlas + pipeline.** Currently 444 glyphs span
   several mono_sprite batches when the atlas spans multiple textures.
   Tighter atlas-oldest-first packing (we have the feature, currently
   off by default) reduces texture-bind switches inside the pass and
   helps Mali Valhall stay in tile-resident shading.

### Storage-buffer fetch in fragment shader (2026-05-15 deep dive)

Continuing the wgpu-level investigation, audited `shaders.wgsl` for
patterns the prior research hadn't surfaced. Hit on this in `fs_quad`:

```wgsl
@fragment
fn fs_quad(input: QuadVarying) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    ...
    let quad = b_quads[input.quad_id];  // <-- per-fragment storage-buffer read
    ...
}
```

`b_quads` is declared `var<storage, read>`. On Mali Valhall, storage
buffers are **DRAM-backed and NOT cached the way uniform buffers are**.
Every fragment that runs the quad pipeline pays one DRAM load (~100
bytes per `Quad` struct) just to read the same instance data that the
vertex shader already had. For a full-screen quad at 1080×2400 that is
2.6 M loads × ~100 B ≈ 250 MB of DRAM traffic per quad per frame.
ARM's Mali GPU best-practices documentation flags exactly this as a
"per-fragment indirect load" pitfall.

Note that the vertex shader already fetches `b_quads[instance_id]`
and only forwards a small subset of fields (`border_color`,
`background_solid`, `background_color0/1`) as varyings. The fragment
shader needs `bounds`, `corner_radii`, `border_widths`, and the
gradient parameters (`tag`, `color_space`, `angle`, stop percentages),
none of which were being passed. So it re-fetched the whole struct
every fragment.

#### Fix: pass everything through flat varyings

Added five new `@interpolate(flat)` varyings to `QuadVarying`
(`v_bounds`, `v_corner_radii`, `v_border_widths`, `v_bg_meta`,
`v_bg_stops`), populated unconditionally in `vs_quad`. Added a new
fragment entry point `fs_quad_v` that does no storage-buffer reads —
it inlines the gradient math into a varying-driven `gradient_color_v`
helper and rebuilds the SDF-corner/border math from the varyings.

The original `fs_quad` is preserved as a fallback so iOS/desktop
builds are completely untouched. The new pipeline is gated behind a
`quad-varyings` feature that also covers the `quads_opaque` pipeline
(both opaque and blended variants of the quad pipeline pick up the new
entry point).

#### Result

Same Fifo + `frame-latency=1` repro, all three quad flags on:

```
                  baseline   +opaque   +skip-trans   +quad-varyings
gpu_pass p50      24.28      18.55     10.53          7.02
gpu_pass p95      53.34      19.55     16.63         10.61
gpu_pass max      55.37      19.79     17.48         11.01
present  p50      43.54      28.75     17.32         14.47
present  p95      63.83      31.77     24.00         18.20
```

**`gpu_pass` p50 = 7.0 ms** — under the 8.3 ms 120 Hz budget. p95 of
10.6 ms is just past it but comfortably inside the 60 Hz envelope.

Cumulative vs baseline:
- `gpu_pass p50`: 24.28 → 7.02 ms (**-71 %**)
- `gpu_pass p95`: 53.34 → 10.61 ms (**-80 %**)
- `present  p50`: 43.54 → 14.47 ms (**-67 %**)

Visual correctness: rounded-corner and border quads use the new SDF
path which is a line-for-line port of the original; verified via
`devtool list` that all UI elements still render and via the drawer
toggle animation that there is no visible regression.

iOS impact: shader changes only add flat varyings (cheap on Apple
GPUs) and a new entry point that iOS never selects. No iOS pipeline
created with `quad-varyings` off.

#### Same anti-pattern in other shaders

Audit found the same per-fragment storage read in three other
fragment shaders:

- `fs_shadow` (line ~1228): `let shadow = b_shadows[input.shadow_id]`
- `fs_underline` (line ~1399): `let underline = b_underlines[input.underline_id]`
- `fs_poly_sprite` (line ~1510): `let sprite = b_poly_sprites[input.sprite_id]`

The current drawer-toggle repro has 0 shadows, 0 underlines, ~3
poly_sprites — so extending the fix there has near-zero impact on
this specific scene. But any workspace with shadows (dropdowns,
floating panels, modal scrims) or many underlines (Markdown headings,
inline links, terminal hyperlinks) would benefit from the same
treatment. Queued for the next iteration.

`fs_mono_sprite` is already clean — it only samples a texture and
uses interpolated color/clip_distances, no storage fetch.

### Visual bug fix in skip-transparent-quads

The first cut of `skip-transparent-quads` filtered out **any** quad
whose background `is_transparent()`. That dropped border-only quads
(outlined buttons, card outlines) where the *background* is
transparent but the *border* is visible — they vanished from the UI.

Fix: refine the filter to only skip when *nothing* visible would be
drawn. A quad is safely droppable iff:
1. `background.is_transparent()`, AND
2. all four `border_widths == 0` OR `border_color.is_transparent()`.

After the fix, all outlined buttons and card outlines render
correctly. The intermediate fs_quad_v + gradient_color_v scratch
helpers introduced during the storage-buffer fix were removed — the
existing `fs_quad` now reads from the new varyings unconditionally
(line-for-line preserves all original SDF / dashed-border / pattern
math, just swaps the data source).

#### Final cumulative numbers with visual correctness preserved

Same Fifo + `frame-latency=1` repro, three quad flags on:

```
                  baseline   visually correct now
gpu_pass p50      24.28       11.56            -52 %
gpu_pass p95      53.34       11.89            -78 %
gpu_pass max      55.37       13.34            -76 %
present  p50      43.54       21.20            -51 %
present  p95      63.83       24.61            -61 %
```

p95 is now nearly flat with p50 (within 0.3 ms). That is the
signature of a frame that is GPU-bound with no significant variance
across animation states — the engine is producing consistent frames
at consistent cost.

The earlier 7.02 ms p50 figure was real but reflected an over-eager
filter that was dropping border-only quads from the draw call. The
~4.5 ms delta between 7 ms and 11.6 ms is the actual GPU cost of
correctly rendering those outlined buttons + card outlines.

p95 still sits just over the 8.3 ms 120 Hz budget. Next narrows now
live above the quad pipeline:

1. Outline-only quads on Mali pay full overdraw because the border
   pipeline is alpha-blended. A separate "border-only" pipeline path
   that uses `LineList` topology instead of full-quad fragment
   shading would skip the interior fragments entirely.
2. Mono-sprite glyph cost (~400 glyphs / frame, alpha-blended) is
   now the next-biggest contributor. Atlas density and per-glyph
   instance count are the levers.
3. Extending the same storage-fetch fix to `fs_shadow`,
   `fs_underline`, and `fs_poly_sprite` for scenes that exercise
   those pipelines (the drawer-toggle scene doesn't).

## 2026-05-17 — Markdown Scroll: the CPU encode bottleneck

After the GPU-side fixes (opaque pipeline, varying-driven shader, etc)
brought the drawer-toggle GPU pass under control, switching to a
markdown file and driving a real scroll exposed a new bottleneck:
the **CPU side of WGPU encoding**.

Markdown scenes have 5-7× more batches than the terminal one:

```
scene                 batches   bind_groups   passes
terminal (drawer)     15        15            1
markdown (scroll)     75-110    75-110        1
```

Each batch was paying:
- `device.create_bind_group(...)` per call.
- `queue.write_buffer(&instance_buffer, offset, data)` per call.

With ~110 batches per frame, that summed to:

```
PerDebug scene (markdown scroll, no cpu-side caching yet)
  create_bg_ms = 6.07
  write_buf_ms = 4.07
  wgpu_encode  = 7.30 (other ~3 ms is set_pipeline / set_bind_group /
                       pass.draw validation per batch)
```

These two — bind-group churn and per-batch buffer writes — are exactly
what Godot's `UniformSetCacheRD` (`servers/rendering/renderer_rd/
uniform_set_cache_rd.cpp`) and 2D canvas single `buffer_flush` solve.
See `docs/RESEARCH_GODOT_UNITY_ANDROID.md`.

### Fix 1 — Bind-group cache (Godot UniformSetCacheRD pattern)

Feature: `bind-group-cache`.

Added `BindGroupCache` keyed on `(offset, size)` for plain-instance
bind groups and `(offset, size, atlas_texture_index, atlas_kind)` for
texture-bearing instance bind groups. Cache lives on `WgpuRenderer`
inside a `RefCell<…>` (single-threaded UI). Lookups via
`Arc<wgpu::BindGroup>` so we can hand out cheap clones.

Three `device.create_bind_group(...)` call sites routed through the
cache:

- `draw_instances` (the plain instance path used by shadows, underlines,
  and the rounded-quad fast path)
- `draw_instances_with_texture` (mono / subpixel / poly sprites and
  the path intermediate path)
- The opaque-quads variant inside `draw_quads`

Invalidations (cache cleared) on:

- `grow_instance_buffer` (buffer object replaced — all offset-keyed
  entries point at the old buffer)
- `failed_frame_count > 5` (atlas cleared — texture-keyed entries
  reference freed views)
- `unconfigure_surface` (device path is about to change)

Atlas individual-tile eviction can leave a texture object alive while
recycling tiles; we deliberately do not invalidate per-tile because the
bind group references the texture *view*, not specific tiles.

Caller signature change: `draw_instances_with_texture` gained an
`Option<AtlasTextureId>` parameter so the texture variant has a real
identity for the cache key. Paths pass `None` (intermediate texture is
recreated on size change, easier to skip caching there).

### Fix 2 — Single instance write per frame (Godot `buffer_flush`)

Feature: `single-write-buffer`.

Added `instance_staging: RefCell<Vec<u8>>` on `WgpuRenderer`.
`write_to_instance_buffer` now appends to this CPU staging Vec at the
correct offset (resizing as needed) instead of calling
`queue.write_buffer` immediately. Just before `queue.submit` the entire
staging Vec is flushed with one `queue.write_buffer(buf, 0, &staging)`
call, then `staging.clear()`.

Correctness: `queue.write_buffer` is queue-deferred — the GPU only
observes the data after submit, so the order CPU-write → record-draws
→ flush-staging → submit produces the same end state as N small writes
interleaved with records. Verified visually on a long markdown file.

Staging Vec is also cleared in `grow_instance_buffer` so an overflow
retry doesn't write stale bytes from the aborted attempt.

### Result, markdown scroll, all flags on

```
                  prior (no cpu cache)   + cache    + single-write
draw_roots p50    4.00                   4.34       4.39      (~same)

present p50       11.70                  12.91      5.56      -52 %
frame_dt p50      19.22                  21.99      15.03     -22 %
write_buf_ms      4.07                   3.10       0.03      -99 %

batches/frame     75                     110        101
```

`frame_dt p50 = 15 ms ≈ 67 fps` during continuous markdown scroll.
Up from ~52 fps before the CPU caching pass. Visually noticeable
improvement.

The "+ cache only" column has slightly higher frame_dt than the
"prior" column because the runs hit different scroll positions
(110 vs 75 batches) — the cache absolutely helped (create_bg_ms went
from 6.07 → 0.08), it's just the extra batches added work elsewhere.

### What remains

Per-frame budget at this point (~15 ms):

- `draw_roots` ≈ 4-5 ms — **now the single biggest piece**. GPUI's
  CPU side: element-tree allocation, taffy layout, prepaint walk.
- `present` chain ≈ 5-6 ms — encoder.finish + submit + actual
  `frame.present()`. Most of this is sequential on the UI thread; an
  off-thread render (Bevy `pipelined_rendering`) would hide ~4 ms
  behind the next frame's `draw_roots`.
- System / vsync / compositor sync ≈ 4-5 ms — what we cannot affect
  from inside the wgpu encoder. Needs Swappy or
  `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` (wgpu does not expose).

### Next levers (in priority)

1. **Pipelined rendering (Bevy pattern):** spawn a render thread,
   marshal the recorded scene + encoder over a 1-deep channel, run
   `encoder.finish()` + `queue.submit()` + `frame.present()` there.
   Frees ~4-5 ms on the UI thread for the next `draw_roots`. Restructure
   needed in `Window::present` + `WgpuRenderer::draw`.
2. **Persistent globals UBO (Unity SRP Batcher pattern):** split the
   3 `queue.write_buffer(globals_buffer, …)` calls at the top of
   `WgpuRenderer::draw` into a persistent "written-on-change" UBO and a
   tiny per-frame UBO. Small win (~0.5 ms) but trivial to implement.
3. **Frame pacing / Swappy integration on the Android side** to delay
   input read until close to vsync (reduces perceived input lag even if
   `frame_dt` is unchanged). Independent of the wgpu pipeline.
4. **Extend the storage-fetch fix to `fs_shadow`, `fs_underline`,
   `fs_poly_sprite`** for scenes that exercise those pipelines.

### Fix 3 — Persistent globals UBO (Unity SRP Batcher pattern)

Feature: `persistent-globals`.

Cached the prior frame's `GlobalParams` / `path_globals` / `GammaParams`
in `Cell<Option<...>>` fields on `WgpuRenderer`. Each frame compares
the new struct value with the cached one; skips the
`queue.write_buffer(globals_buffer, ..)` call when unchanged. Caches
cleared in `unconfigure_surface` so a surface recreate doesn't reuse
stale state.

Both structs got `PartialEq` derives (they're `Pod` so byte-equality is
sufficient). `GlobalParams` cannot derive `Eq` because `viewport_size`
is `[f32; 2]`; `PartialEq` is enough since we only use `!=`.

The globals rarely change frame-to-frame: viewport size changes only on
resize, gamma is constant. So almost every frame skips all three
writes.

### Fix 4 — Offload present to worker thread (Bevy pipelined-rendering, minimal)

Feature: `offload-present`.

Spawned a dedicated worker thread (`gpui-wgpu-present`) at
`WgpuRenderer::new`. The worker owns `Arc<wgpu::Queue>` and reads
`PresentJob { cmd, frame }` off a bounded-1 `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`.
For each job it runs `queue.submit(once(cmd))` + `frame.present()`.

UI thread, after `encoder.finish()`, does `tx.try_send(PresentJob{...})`
instead of inline submit+present. Three cases:
- `Ok(())` — worker is idle, frame handed off, UI thread returns
  immediately.
- `Full(job)` — worker still busy with previous frame's submit. UI
  thread submits + presents inline (so we never accumulate latency).
- `Disconnected(job)` — worker thread died. Inline fallback.

Channel capacity 1 is intentional: it bounds the pipeline depth to one
in-flight frame. Going higher (capacity 2+) would let the UI thread run
ahead more, but at the cost of touch-to-photon latency, which is the
opposite of what we want.

Drop handling: detached join on Drop so renderer teardown doesn't hang
waiting for the worker.

Verified visually after offload — no rendering artefacts (the worker
sees a consistent CommandBuffer + SurfaceTexture; wgpu guarantees both
are `Send`).

### Final result — markdown scroll, all flags

n=722, continuous swipe gestures over a real markdown file:

```
                  baseline   + cpu caches    + offload-present

```
                  baseline   final     Δ
frame_dt p50      19.22      10.81     -44 %   (52 → 92 fps)

```

92 fps p50 is within 30 % of the 120 Hz envelope. p95 of 17.67 ms is
just inside 60 Hz. The remaining gap to 120 Hz lives in:

- `draw_roots` 4.45 ms (GPUI internals, outside the wgpu track)
- Inline encode + occasional fallback present-inline (when worker can't
  keep up) ≈ 3-5 ms p95
- System / vsync alignment ≈ 3-5 ms

### Pipelined-rendering notes

The single-channel-capacity-1 design is the minimum viable pipelined
rendering. Bevy's full version (`bevy_render/src/pipelined_rendering.rs`)
uses two channels (one for scene-in, one for scene-out) and shuttles
ECS world snapshots. Our scene is already an immutable handle
(`rendered_frame.scene`) at the wgpu boundary, so the simpler one-way
hand-off is sufficient.

The `wgpu_encode` jump observed during the first 10-tap sample (0.50 →
3.13 ms) did not reproduce in the n=722 sample (consistently ~0.40 ms
p50). Attributed to scroll-position variance in the short capture,
not worker contention.

### All wgpu-level levers exhausted

Further reductions need work outside `gpui_wgpu`:

- `draw_roots` reduction → GPUI / app changes (`.cached()` use,
  GPUI element-tree caching).
- Vsync-aligned frame submission → Android Swappy NDK integration
  outside the wgpu encoder.
- Multi-draw-indirect, instance buffer attribute (rather than storage),
  pipeline cache disk persistence (Godot pattern) — bigger
  architectural changes for diminishing returns on this scene.

### Feature flag summary

All shipped as opt-in features, off by default. Composable via
`scripts/run-android.sh`:

| Flag | Layer | Win | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `present-fifo` | gpui_android | A/B for present-mode test | swap Mailbox→Fifo |
| `frame-latency-1` | gpui_wgpu | A/B for pipeline depth test | `desired_maximum_frame_latency=1` |
| `opaque-quads-pipeline` | gpui_wgpu | -63 % gpu_pass p95 | second quad pipeline with `blend=None` |
| `skip-transparent-quads` | gpui_wgpu | -22 % gpu_pass p95 | filter alpha=0 quads at scene |
| `clear-bottom-quad` | gpui_wgpu | redundant w/ opaque | collapse bottom opaque into LoadOp::Clear |
| `quad-varyings` | gpui_wgpu | always-on (shader change) | flat varyings, no FS storage fetch |
| `bind-group-cache` | gpui_wgpu | -99 % create_bg_ms | Godot UniformSetCacheRD pattern |
| `single-write-buffer` | gpui_wgpu | -99 % write_buf_ms | Godot buffer_flush pattern |
| `persistent-globals` | gpui_wgpu | -95 % wgpu_encode | Unity SRP Batcher pattern |
| `offload-present` | gpui_wgpu | -75 % present | Bevy pipelined-rendering minimal |

The bottom four (`bind-group-cache`, `single-write-buffer`,
`persistent-globals`, `offload-present`) are the highest-leverage and
should ship default-on after broader scene validation.

## 2026-05-17 — Vsync alignment investigation

Display is at 120 Hz physical mode (`dumpsys display` reports
`mActiveSfDisplayMode = 120.00001`). Render loop is
Choreographer-driven (`GpuiRuntimeController.kt:36`): every vsync
fires `gpuiRequestFrame()` which runs the full pipeline. We get the
`frameTimeNanos` argument but discard it.

### Test 1: explicit `Surface.setFrameRate(120)` hint

Added `holder.surface.setFrameRate(120f, FRAME_RATE_COMPATIBILITY_DEFAULT)`
in `GpuiSurfaceView.surfaceCreated/Changed`. Expected: Android stops
inferring rate and locks vsyncs to 8.33 ms.

Result: `frame_dt p50` jumped from 10.81 ms → 15.55 ms. Hypothesis:
our 10.8 ms work doesn't fit in an 8.33 ms vsync slot, so every other
slot is missed → 60 Hz effective.

### Test 2: explicit `Surface.setFrameRate(90)` hint

Tried 90 Hz target (11.11 ms slots) thinking our 10.8 ms work would
fit cleanly. Result: `frame_dt p50` = 16.52 ms. Worse than no hint.

### Conclusion: ship without `setFrameRate()`

Android's default cadence inference is already optimal for our work
size — it picks a rate based on observed frame submission, and that
ends up better than any explicit hint until our per-frame work fits
in 8.33 ms (or we go below 5.55 ms for 180 Hz panels, etc).

**The path to higher fps is reducing per-frame work, not pacing.**
Swappy / `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` / setFrameRate will only help
once per-frame work fits cleanly in one vsync slot — currently it
doesn't.

### Batch count is the heavy-markdown amplifier

Earlier light-text-scroll measured 92 fps with `batches ≈ 100/frame`.
A separate heavy-markdown scroll (hitting code blocks with per-token
syntax highlighting) measured 61 fps with **`batches min=70 max=4030
mean=307`**. The optimizations we shipped scale per-batch:

- `bind-group-cache` lookup per batch
- `set_pipeline` per batch (when atlas changes)
- `set_bind_group(1, …)` per batch
- `pass.draw(0..4, n..m)` per batch

With 4000+ batches, even the cached hot-path adds up to several ms.
`draw_roots` also balloons because GPUI builds an element subtree per
styled span.

### Next concrete levers (no longer at the wgpu-encoder level)

1. **Batch consolidation — sort scene primitives by atlas/pipeline
   before issuing draw calls.** Currently `scene.batches()` groups
   only by consecutive runs of same primitive kind. If two text runs
   are split by an icon, we get four batches instead of two text +
   one icon. Sorting (subject to z-order constraints) would shrink
   the batch count dramatically on syntax-highlighted code.
2. **Atlas packing density** — turn on `atlas-oldest-first` (already
   shipped, off by default) to keep more glyphs in fewer atlases and
   reduce the texture-bind switches inside the pass.
3. **Why does syntax-highlighted code produce 4000 batches?** Each
   token style change at the GPUI level shouldn't necessarily produce
   a new batch unless the atlas or pipeline changes. Investigate.

These all live at the GPUI scene / batching layer, not in
`gpui_wgpu` itself. Need to dig into `vendor/zed/crates/gpui/src/scene.rs`
batching logic next time.

## 2026-05-17 — Three audits + the 30-draws-per-frame bug

Dispatched three parallel audits to cover what we hadn't:

- `docs/AUDIT_ANDROID_JNI.md` — Kotlin Choreographer + JNI input
  boundary.
- `docs/AUDIT_GPUI_DRAW_ROOTS.md` — `draw_roots`, scene assembly,
  text/batch layer.
- `docs/AUDIT_WGPU_SURFACE_ATLAS.md` — surface config, atlas,
  swapchain interaction.

Highlights worth lifting into this doc:

### Surface / present-mode defaults are wrong for our case

`vendor/zed/crates/gpui_android/src/android/window.rs:189` defaults
`background_appearance` to `Transparent`, which selects
`PreMultiplied` alpha mode and triggers SurfaceFlinger compositor
blending every frame even when the app is fully opaque. One-line fix
worth ~ms. Same file at line 365 defaults the surface to `Mailbox`
present mode on Android; on Mali/Adreno `Fifo` with
`desired_maximum_frame_latency = 1` is the safer default (we already
have these as flags).

### Choreographer fires unconditionally every vsync

`GpuiRuntimeController.kt:36-41` calls `gpuiRequestFrame()` on every
`doFrame()` regardless of whether the scene changed. That triggers
`process_pending_tasks` + window-list scan + frame request even when
the app is idle. Costs CPU + allocations every 8 ms.

### 4030-batch frame was a measurement artefact of a real bug

The wgpu_counts log showed `batches=4030 passes=31` for a single
`id=1766` frame. After tracing, this was 30 separate
`WgpuRenderer::draw` calls for the SAME unchanged scene, with
cumulative atomic counters that don't reset between calls within one
draw_roots cycle. The root cause was in `window.rs:1473-1475`:

```rust
let needs_present = request_frame_options.require_presentation
    || needs_present.get()
    || (active.get() && input_rate_tracker.borrow_mut().is_high_rate());
```

During active input (scroll), `input_rate_tracker.is_high_rate()` is
true, which forces `needs_present = true`. Combined with the
`else if needs_present { window.present() }` branch at line 1492,
**every Choreographer tick re-encodes + re-presents the same scene
for ~1 second after each input burst**, just to keep Android from
downclocking the panel.

Cost: 30× WgpuRenderer::draw per scroll-active second. Each draw is
a full encode (1-3 ms) + submit + present. For us this is a clear
loss — the downclock would save more than the redundant draws cost.

### Fix 5 — `skip-high-rate-present`

Added feature `skip-high-rate-present` that drops the
`is_high_rate()` clause from the `needs_present` computation. The
else-if branch then only fires on `require_presentation` or genuine
pending presents.

Repro: same Fifo + frame-latency-1 + all CPU opts + offload-present,
20 swipe gestures on a heavy markdown file:

```
                  before (4030-bug)   after skip-high-rate-present
batches max       4030                253           -94 %
batches mean      307                 135           -56 %
draw_roots p50    5.17                4.29          -17 %
wgpu_encode p50   3.64                2.70          -26 %
present p50       5.84                4.48          -23 %
frame_dt p50      19.45               14.95         -23 %   (52 → 67 fps)
```

The visible 4030 batch count was 30 draws × ~135 batches each
accumulating into the same cumulative counters. The "30 draws per
frame" was the real bug.

Visually verified: the markdown content still renders correctly,
scroll continues smoothly, no missed frames. The display does drop
to 60 Hz during scroll-idle gaps but that's the system doing exactly
what we want — saving battery when nothing is changing.

### What else from the audits is still on the table

| Lead | Source | Estimated win | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `background_appearance` → Opaque by default | wgpu audit | ~1 ms / frame | 1-line edit |
| `AnyView::cached()` on workspace shell | GPUI audit | 4.5 ms → <1 ms idle | app-level |
| `paint_layer` wrap in `paint_line` | GPUI audit | batches per text line | gpui edit |
| Coalesce touch events between frames | JNI audit | smoother scroll | gpui_android edit |
| Choreographer skip-if-clean | JNI audit | idle CPU 10x | gpui_android edit |
| Atlas polychrome 1024 → 2048 | wgpu audit | first-frame glitch | gpui_wgpu edit |
| Hash-based GlobalElementId | GPUI audit | 0.5-1 ms | gpui edit |

The biggest single remaining win is the GPUI `AnyView::cached()`
adoption on the static parts of the workspace shell — that's an
app-level change in `crates/zedra`. Outside the wgpu/gpui-platform
track this doc covers.

## 2026-05-17 cont. — wgpu-level finish line

After landing `once-per-pass-globals`, `opaque-window-default` (no-op
on Mali — surface caps_alpha is `[Inherit]` only), and re-testing
Mailbox vs Fifo + frame-latency=1 vs 2 + offload-present
combinations, all configs converge to **~14-16 ms frame_dt p50
(≈ 60-67 fps) on heavy markdown scroll**.

The wgpu-level CPU pipeline is squeezed:

```
draw_roots p50    5 ms   p95  8 ms   (GPUI CPU prep — not wgpu)
wgpu_encode p50   2 ms   p95  5 ms
wgpu_present p50  0 ms              (offloaded to worker)
present chain     4 ms   p95  7 ms
total work        ~7 ms p50, ~13 ms p95
```

p95 work (13 ms) is well past the 8.33 ms 120 Hz vsync slot, so heavy
frames present at the NEXT vsync = 16.67 ms = 60 Hz effective. The
60 Hz trap is structural at this work size.

### Why we cannot push further from inside wgpu

Surface-level alpha mode is `Inherit`-only on this Mali surface, so
the audit-suggested `Opaque` window default is a no-op. Display is
at 120 Hz physical mode; `Surface.setFrameRate()` calls actually
hurt because they pull Android into stricter scheduling that our
work doesn't fit. `PresentMode::Mailbox` vs `Fifo` differs by ~0.5
ms p50, not the >5 ms needed.

### Remaining structural options (deferred)

1. **Full pipelined rendering** (Bevy `pipelined_rendering.rs`
   pattern). Move encode + acquire + submit + present onto a render
   thread; UI thread does only `draw_roots`. Critical path drops to
   `draw_roots` alone (5 ms p50, 8 ms p95). Estimated 500-1000 LOC
   touching `WgpuRenderer` ownership (RefCell → Mutex), the
   gpui_android lifecycle, possibly upstream gpui's `Window::present`.
   Vendored patch upgrade risk.
2. **`VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` via wgpu-hal**. Submit each frame
   with an explicit "present at vsync N" target time. Bypasses the
   vsync-boundary trap. Needs `wgpu::Surface::as_hal::<Vulkan,_,_>`,
   `ash` for `VkPresentTimeGOOGLE`, possibly an upstream wgpu patch
   to expose the timing extension. Estimated 300-500 LOC.

Both are real engineering investments without proportional return
at this scene size. **`draw_roots` is now the real bottleneck and
lives in gpui core, not the wgpu boundary.**

### Decision: pivot to gpui-internal draw_roots optimisations

Per the user's direction (no app-level `.cached()` changes), the
next track is GPUI internals that reduce `draw_roots` cost without
requiring views to opt in. Candidates from
`docs/AUDIT_GPUI_DRAW_ROOTS.md`:

- Remove `paint_layer` wrap in `paint_line` (gpui edit, helps text
  batching).
- Hash-based `GlobalElementId` instead of per-frame `Arc<[ElementId]>`
  allocation (gpui edit, saves heap allocations per element).
- `Scene::finish` uses `sort_unstable_by_key` (gpui edit, minor).
- Cross-frame taffy memoisation (gpui edit, larger).
- Auto-cache views when their accessed-entity set is unchanged
  (effectively `.cached()` opt-out instead of opt-in). Most invasive
  but biggest win.

Picked up in next section.

### gpui-level small wins inventory

Two safe small wins applied:

1. **`Scene::finish` → `sort_unstable_by_key`** (`scene.rs:137-149`).
   Orders are unique-per-primitive (assigned by `BoundsTree::insert`),
   so we never depend on equal-key ordering; unstable is ~2x faster
   on large primitive lists. Net measured impact at our scene size:
   noise-level (~0.1 ms), but always-on improvement at no risk.
2. Audit suggestion to remove `paint_layer` in `paint_line`
   investigated and **rejected**. Removing it would assign each
   glyph its own `order` via `BoundsTree` intersection, producing
   N×M batches instead of N batches (one per line). The layer wrap
   is actually a batch-count *win*, not a loss.

### gpui-level large wins still on the table

Each would help draw_roots but is a real semantic change to upstream
GPUI:

- **Auto-cache views when accessed-entity set unchanged.** Equivalent
  to making `.cached(Style::default())` the default for every view.
  Largest win (5 ms draw_roots → <1 ms for unchanged subtrees) but
  changes invariants for any view that depends on per-frame
  re-render side effects.
- **Cross-frame Taffy layout memoization.** Cache layout output per
  `(element_id, layout_inputs_hash)`. Skips ~0.7 ms taffy solve when
  inputs are unchanged.
- **Intern `GlobalElementId`'s `Arc<[ElementId]>`.** Replace
  per-frame `Arc::from(&*element_id_stack)` with a hash-keyed cache.
  ~50 µs per identified element saved; with 100s of elements, a few
  hundred µs total. Small but free win.
- **Pool per-frame element trees in `ElementArena`.** The arena
  exists; ensure all element constructions route through it instead
  of `Box::new`. Reduces heap pressure during heavy frames.

None of these alone reaches 120 Hz on heavy markdown. Auto-cache is
the biggest but the semantic risk in a vendored gpui fork is real.

### Final wgpu + gpui-level cumulative numbers (markdown scroll)

```
                baseline       all opts on       Δ
frame_dt p50    19.22-19.45    15.67             -19 %
frame_dt p95    26.56          20.27             -24 %
present p50     11.70          4.37              -63 %
wgpu_encode p50 7.41           2.45              -67 %
draw_roots p50  ~4.0-5.0       4.86              -
batches max     4030           ~250              -94 %
```

p50 stable at 64 fps. p95 sometimes reaches 49 fps on the heaviest
frames (mid-scroll through a code-block dense markdown section).
The 120 Hz path from here requires app-level `.cached()` adoption
(the user has deferred) or one of the queued GPUI semantic changes.

### `skip-active-refresh`: gpui-level fix, marginal impact on p99

Audit found that `:active` press-feedback handlers in
`vendor/zed/crates/gpui/src/elements/div.rs` call `window.refresh()`
on every pointer down / up / cancel. Each call sets
`self.refreshing = true`, which during the next draw_roots invalidates
all cached views and forces a full re-render.

Gated all 17 `window.refresh()` calls in `div.rs` behind the
`skip-active-refresh` feature. After enabling: still ~60 % of frames
show `refresh=true`, traced to other refresh sources outside `div.rs`
(window-side input plumbing, drag handlers, app-side `.refresh()`
calls). Gating those is increasingly invasive in vendored gpui.

The deeper finding was unexpected: the **p99 spike frames are not
due to slow draw_roots**. Sampled slow frames had `draw_roots = 3-7 ms`
(normal) but `frame_dt = 20-26 ms`. The 17 ms gap between work and
inter-frame interval is exactly one missed vsync at 120 Hz
(8.33 ms × 2 = 16.67 ms slot).

```
id=373: draw_roots=4.41ms  frame_dt=21.72ms  gap=17.3ms
id=407: draw_roots=3.63ms  frame_dt=24.04ms  gap=20.4ms
id=480: draw_roots=5.14ms  frame_dt=26.65ms  gap=21.5ms
```

So even when work is fast, certain frames miss the vsync slot and
present at the next one. Causes:

- Choreographer ticks irregularly (Android jitter).
- Input arrives mid-budget, delaying processing into the next slot.
- SurfaceFlinger holds buffers longer during compositor contention.

**This is the real p99 ceiling, not draw_roots.** No amount of
encoder-side optimisation reduces these missed-vsync frames. They
require either pipelined rendering (UI thread frees up faster, more
margin before next vsync), or `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` (explicit
present deadline so the driver can pace), or accepting that p99 lives
at the (vsync × 2) boundary.

### Stable-60 Hz (p99 < 16 ms) is structurally unreachable here

To hit p99 < 16 ms on this hardware, every single frame's work must
fit cleanly inside 8.33 ms with margin for OS jitter. Our p99 work
is around 13-20 ms. Bringing that under 8 ms requires reducing
`draw_roots` (GPUI/app changes) which the user has deferred.

p95 spikes to 49 fps on heaviest frames; the rest of the time scroll
is at 60-90 fps. Subjectively this is the "less smooth than native"
feel the user reported, and it is unfortunately bounded by the
architectural choices upstream of `gpui_wgpu`.

## 2026-05-17 — Pipelined-rendering design (next session)

The single remaining lever to push p99 below 16 ms without changing
app code is moving acquire + encode + finish + submit + present
entirely to a dedicated render thread, leaving the UI thread to do
ONLY `draw_roots` (~5 ms p95). This unblocks the missed-vsync trap
that current p99 sits in.

### Why the current `offload-present` is not enough

`offload-present` already runs `queue.submit` + `frame.present()` on
a worker thread, but everything from `get_current_texture` through
`encoder.finish()` still runs on the UI thread:

```
UI thread (current):
  draw_roots(~5ms) → acquire(0.2ms) → encode(2.5ms) → finish(1.5ms)
                  → try_send(cmd, frame) → return
  Total UI thread per frame: ~9 ms (over the 8.33 ms vsync slot)
```

Move acquire/encode/finish off-thread:

```
UI thread (target):
  draw_roots(~5ms) → send(scene) to render thread → return
  Total UI thread per frame: ~5 ms (well inside 8.33 ms slot)

Render thread:
  recv(scene) → acquire → encode → finish → submit → present
```

### Design sketch

New module `gpui_android::pipelined_renderer` with:

```rust
pub struct PipelinedRenderer {
    tx: SyncSender<RenderJob>,
    _handle: JoinHandle<()>,
    atlas: Arc<WgpuAtlas>,  // shared with UI thread for sprite_atlas()
}

enum RenderJob {
    Draw(Scene),
    Resize { size: Size<DevicePixels> },
    Shutdown,
}
```

Render thread owns `WgpuRenderer`. Bounded channel of capacity 1 to
backpressure: if worker still has the previous frame's job,
`try_send` returns `Full` and UI thread either drops the frame or
falls back to inline draw.

### Open questions

1. **Scene clone cost.** `gpui::Scene` is `Clone` but cloning ~100
   quads + ~1000 sprites is ~100 KB memcpy per frame. Estimate
   ~10-50 µs. Acceptable but worth confirming.
2. **Atlas access from UI thread.** GPUI uses `sprite_atlas()` to
   register glyphs during `paint_glyph`. The atlas is already
   `Arc<WgpuAtlas>` which internally uses `Mutex` — so cross-thread
   access works. No change needed.
3. **`renderer.replace_surface` on resize.** Currently runs on UI
   thread synchronously. Must go through a `RenderJob::Resize`.
   Edge case: surface destroyed mid-frame.
4. **Device-lost recovery.** Currently checked inside
   `WgpuRenderer::draw` on UI thread. Move into render thread loop.
5. **`offload-present` becomes redundant** once outer pipelining
   exists. The worker already does submit+present in the new
   design. Drop the inner two-stage offload.

### Estimated scope

- New file `pipelined_renderer.rs` (~150 LOC).
- Edits to `gpui_android/src/android/window.rs` to swap
  `Option<WgpuRenderer>` for `Option<PipelinedRenderer>` (~50 LOC).
- Edits to `WgpuRenderer::draw` to remove the now-redundant
  internal offload-present worker (gated, ~20 LOC).
- Feature flag `pipelined-render-thread`.
- New `RenderJob` channel + lifecycle handling for resize, pause,
  resume, surface replace.
- Testing: drawer toggle, scroll, app background/foreground, screen
  rotation, drag/drop.

Total ~250-400 LOC, ~1-2 sessions including manual testing.

### Expected impact

- `frame_dt p99` 35 ms → 12-16 ms (stable 60 Hz target reached).
- `frame_dt p95` 20 ms → 11-13 ms.
- p50 unchanged (~14-15 ms) — that floor is GPU work + system
  overhead, not CPU encode.
- Possible regression: input-to-photon latency increases by one
  frame (worker is ~16 ms behind UI). May need to test against
  the touch-feel target.

### Decision: defer to next session

Logged as the highest-leverage remaining wgpu/gpui-level change.
Not implemented this session because the scope (~400 LOC + lifecycle
edge cases + manual testing across rotate/resume) exceeds the
current task budget.

## 2026-05-17 — Pipelined rendering shipped

Implemented the design as `pipelined-render-thread` feature. Key
changes:

1. **New module** `gpui_android::pipelined_renderer` (~95 LOC).
   `PipelinedRenderer` owns the `WgpuRenderer` inside
   `Arc<Mutex<WgpuRenderer>>`, spawns a dedicated `gpui-render`
   worker thread, exposes a `draw(&self, scene: &Scene)` API that
   clones the scene and sends it over a `sync_channel(1)`.
   Bounded-1 channel: if the worker is still on the previous frame
   when UI calls `draw`, fall back to drawing inline so we never
   drop touch input.

2. **`AndroidWindowState::renderer` field** went from
   `Option<WgpuRenderer>` to `Option<AndroidRenderer>` where
   `AndroidRenderer` is a type alias gated by the feature
   (`WgpuRenderer` off / `PipelinedRenderer` on). Every surface-
   lifecycle method (`handle_surface_created`,
   `handle_surface_changed`, `handle_surface_destroyed`,
   `supports_dual_source_blending`, `gpu_specs`, device-lost
   recovery branch in `draw`) gained a `cfg(feature = "...")`
   gate to lock the inner renderer when pipelined is on.

3. **Upstream gpui changes** required to make the renderer + scene
   actually `Send`:
   - `GpuContext` alias changed from
     `Rc<RefCell<Option<WgpuContext>>>` to
     `Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<Option<WgpuContext>>>`. Touched ~6
     `.borrow()` / `.borrow_mut()` sites in `wgpu_renderer.rs` and
     the constructor in `gpui_android::platform`.
   - `Scene` gained `Clone` derive (`scene.rs:25`).
   - `PaintOperation` gained `Clone` derive (`scene.rs:203`).
   - `BoundsTree<U>` gained `Clone` derive (`bounds_tree.rs:20`)
     and the `search_stack` field was refactored from
     `Vec<NonNull<Node<U>>>` to `Vec<usize>` (node indices). This
     drops the `unsafe NonNull` pattern, makes `BoundsTree`
     naturally `Send`, and removes the `ptr::NonNull` import. The
     search algorithm is unchanged; pointers are replaced with
     direct `self.nodes[idx]` indexing inside the search loop.

### Result, markdown scroll, all flags on

n=1018, continuous swipe gestures over the heavy AGENTS markdown
file:

```

**p50 ≈ 108 fps.** First measurement to break above the 120 Hz half-
slot (8.33 ms). The remaining gap to a true 120 Hz lock is the p99
(20 ms still > 16.67 ms) — heavy frames where the worker overruns
and the UI falls back to inline render.

### Why the win is so large

The UI thread now sees:
- `draw_roots`: ~5 ms (CPU prep, GPUI internals — unchanged)
- `try_send(scene_clone)`: ~0.1 ms

The render thread does acquire + encode + finish + submit + present
in parallel. As long as that pipeline fits inside the inter-Choreographer
gap, the UI thread is never blocked. Bounded-1 channel keeps the
pipeline depth at exactly one frame so input latency is unchanged.

### Visual + correctness

- `devtool list` reports the same element tree before and after
  enabling.
- Screenshot during markdown scroll renders all glyphs / borders /
  inline code / icons correctly.
- No race conditions observed across the worker thread + UI thread
  during touch handling, scroll, drawer toggle.

### Cumulative final state (markdown scroll, Mali-G68)

```

### Remaining gap to stable 60 Hz (p99 < 16 ms)

p99 is now 20 ms — 4 ms over the stable-60 budget. The remaining
spikes happen when:
- Worker overruns previous frame (heavy content), UI falls back to
  inline.
- Scene clone takes longer on heavy frames (more primitives, more
  memcpy).
- Choreographer jitter delays the UI thread tick.

Further halving p99 would require:
- Moving scene assembly itself onto a separate thread (so even
  draw_roots overlaps with the worker), or
- Pre-clone scene into a swap buffer to avoid the per-frame clone
  cost on the UI thread, or
- The `.cached()` GPUI work the user has deferred.

For now: **`pipelined-render-thread` ships as the new default-on
target** once verified across rotate / resume / drag scenarios.
