# probe-peer-health.sh — live end-to-end proof of event-driven dead-peer
# self-healing for the herd router.
#
# Fully event-driven driver: no sleep, no polling loops, no timeouts-as-delays.
#   - Process readiness is signaled over named pipes. The driver blocks on
#     `read` and wakes exactly when the child signals — never a readiness poll,
#     never "give it a moment" sleeps.
#   - The cool-off is never slept through. A single cool-off cannot serve both
#     halves of the proof (fail-fast needs cool-off >> driver latency;
#     immediate recovery needs cool-off << driver latency), so the probe runs
#     the herd twice:
#       run 1 (cool_off_seconds: 3600): proves weighted ejection and fail-fast
#         503 while the circuit is open, without touching the backend.
#       run 2 (cool_off_seconds: 0.005): the cool-off (5ms) is shorter than any
#         real inter-request gap, so the first real request after the backend
#         recovers IS the half-open probe — recovery is demonstrated purely as
#         an event (real traffic), with no waiting whatsoever.
#   - Teardown reaps children with `wait` (SIGCHLD-driven), not sleep.
#   - Ports are picked collision-free (bind port 0) unless overridden.
# The only `read -t` uses are hang backstops: fail loudly if a child dies
# before signaling readiness. The test never waits out a duration to become
# correct.
#
# Spins up, on 127.0.0.1 only:
#   1. a scripted backend (python http.server) with a mode file:
#      healthy | fail500 | empty200
#   2. the herd binary under test with a minimal one-peer config
# then drives and asserts:
#   run 1:
#     A. healthy request -> 200, peer healthy
#     B. fail500 x2 (weight 2.0, threshold 4) -> circuit OPEN
#     C. request while open -> 503 peer_circuit_open, backend untouched,
#        retry_after_ms advertised by the server
#   run 2 (fresh herd, 5ms cool-off):
#     A2. healthy request -> 200, peer healthy
#     B2. fail500 x2 -> circuit OPEN
#     D2. backend healthy again -> the next real request is admitted as the
#         half-open probe -> 200, the backend WAS hit exactly once, peer
#         readmitted to rotation — healthy, or degraded when the rolling
#         error window still holds the earlier failures (no waiting)
#     F2. empty200 x3 (weight 1.5) -> circuit OPEN again (weights differ)
#     G2. backend healthy -> next real request probes -> 200 -> readmitted
#         to rotation
#
# Usage: probe-peer-health.sh [--bin PATH] [--keep]
#   --bin PATH  herd binary to test (default: build from this repo)
#   --keep      leave processes running for manual inspection
#   BE_PORT / HERD_PORT env overrides are honored when free; otherwise ports
#   are allocated collision-free. TMPDIR may point scratch space elsewhere
#   (fifos, logs) if /tmp is cramped.
