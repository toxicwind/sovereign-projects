# GPUI Native Presentations

Native presentation stays in platform-native UI.

- Rust asks through `platform_bridge`.
- Swift presents native UI on iOS.
- Kotlin presents Material UI on Android.
- GPUI does not own alert / action sheet / sheet gestures or animation.

## Current split

- `platform_bridge` is the Rust entry point for native presentation requests.
- `ios/Zedra/Presentations.swift` is the Swift presentation layer.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/dev/zedra/app/NativePresentations.kt` is the
  Android presentation layer.
- `platform_bridge::show_custom_sheet(options, view)` takes the caller-owned GPUI view entity to host in the sheet.
- `platform_bridge::show_native_notification(options)` presents a transient
  native in-app notification.
- `platform_bridge::show_native_notification_with_action(options, callback)`
  presents the same notification and calls the Rust callback when the user taps
  the front notification bubble.
- `native_floating_button(...)` is a GPUI element wrapper that owns position,
  lifecycle, and the caller callback while the native layer draws the platform
  button at the wrapper bounds.
- The native layer owns:
  - alert
  - selection / action sheet
  - in-app notification chrome
  - floating icon button chrome
  - sheet detents
  - sheet gestures
  - sheet animation

## Native notification

Use native notifications for non-blocking, app-local status events: terminal
creation, host-published events, agent completion, background refresh status,
or other state changes that should not interrupt the current workflow.

Do not use native notifications for confirmations, destructive choices, or
errors that require a decision. Use alerts or selection sheets for those.

Basic usage:

```rust
use crate::platform_bridge::{self, NativeNotificationKind, NativeNotificationOptions};

platform_bridge::show_native_notification(
    NativeNotificationOptions::new("Terminal created")
        .message("Host opened a new shell.")
        .system_image("terminal")
        .kind(NativeNotificationKind::Success),
);
```

Usage with a tap action:

```rust
platform_bridge::show_native_notification_with_action(
    NativeNotificationOptions::new("Agent completed")
        .message("Tap to inspect the result.")
        .image("AgentCodex")
        .kind(NativeNotificationKind::Success)
        .duration_secs(4.0),
    || {
        platform_bridge::show_native_notification(
            NativeNotificationOptions::new("Opening result")
                .system_image("hand.tap"),
        );
    },
);
```

Configuration:

- `title`: required by `NativeNotificationOptions::new(title)`.
- `message`: optional secondary text. Keep it short; the native view truncates
  before becoming tall.
- `image(...)`: optional icon name. iOS resolves an asset-catalog image first,
  then falls back to an SF Symbol with the same name. Notification icons are
  rendered as template images and tinted with the same light/dark color as the
  notification title, so SVG assets should use `currentColor` and asset-catalog
  template rendering. Android v1 maps known symbol names to compact text
  symbols and otherwise falls back to a neutral marker.
- `system_image(...)`: alias for `image(...)` when the caller intends an SF
  Symbol.
- `kind`: `Info`, `Success`, `Warning`, or `Error`. The kind controls the
  default icon only; native notifications do not trigger haptic feedback.
- `duration_secs`: optional display duration. Default is `3.2`. iOS clamps
  positive durations to a practical transient range.
- `auto_close`: optional. Default is `true`. Set to `false` only when the
  notification should remain until the user taps or swipes it away.

iOS stack behavior:

- Each call creates an independent notification item.
- New items fade in quickly, enter from above with a near-zero scale, and keep
  settling into full size after opacity has completed.
- Dismissed items fade out quickly, then finish scaling back toward zero while
  translating upward offscreen.
- In the collapsed stack, the newest item is the expanded front bubble.
- Older items peek above it as smaller glass bubbles, so the collapsed stack
  grows upward.
- Only the front bubble receives tap and swipe gestures while collapsed.
- Swipe the front bubble downward to expand the stack downward.
- In the expanded stack, all pending items render as full bubbles from oldest
  at the top to newest at the bottom, and each visible bubble can be tapped or
  swiped.
- When a visible bubble dismisses, the remaining items close the gap smoothly.
- Each item owns its own auto-close timer.

Android v1 behavior:

- Each call creates an independent Material banner near the top safe area.
- Tapping the banner invokes the action callback when one exists, then dismisses
  the banner.
- Auto-close dismissal drops the pending callback without invoking it.
- Android does not implement UIKit glass stack expansion gestures in v1.

Callback behavior:

- `show_native_notification(...)` has no action callback; tapping still
  dismisses the front bubble.
- `show_native_notification_with_action(...)` invokes its callback at most once
  when the user taps the front bubble.
- Auto-close and swipe dismissal drop the pending callback without invoking it.
- App background cleanup calls `platform_bridge::clear_pending_alerts()`, which
  also clears pending native notification callbacks.

Call site rules:

- Call from event handlers, subscriptions, or async tasks. Do not trigger a
  notification from `render()`.
- Route all callers through `platform_bridge`; app UI code should not call
  UIKit, Swift, Kotlin, or Android presentation APIs directly.
- The current concrete renderers are iOS and Android. Desktop/test bridges may
  treat this as a no-op until they add their own native presentation.

## Custom sheet rule

Custom sheet is a native shell, not UIKit content.

- Swift creates the sheet container and canvas view.
- Kotlin creates the Android `BottomSheetDialog` container and sheet surface.
- GPUI renders into the canvas view.
- The sheet body should not be mocked with UIKit or Material labels/buttons.

## Embedded GPUI view

To render inside a native sheet, GPUI needs an embeddable platform surface.

- iOS root mode: GPUI owns a `UIWindow`
- iOS embedded mode: GPUI attaches `GPUIMetalView` into a provided parent `UIView`
- Android root mode: GPUI renders into the root `GpuiSurfaceView`
- Android embedded mode: GPUI renders into a sheet `SheetHostView`

Required pieces:

- FFI/JNI to pass a parent native view or `Surface`
- `gpui_ios` / `gpui_android` path to create an embedded window/view
- resize + frame driving for the embedded surface
- attach / detach when the native container is dismissed or reopened

## Sheet scrolling contract

Sheet-hosted GPUI content can lose direct drag ownership once the native sheet
starts competing for the same gesture.

For custom sheet content that needs inner scrolling:

- Swift owns the outer gesture source through the custom sheet content pan recognizer
- Swift forwards two-dimensional pan deltas into the embedded GPUI window as
  synthetic `ScrollWheel` input
- Android forwards touch and fling input directly to the embedded GPUI sheet
  window from `SheetHostView`.
- GPUI content reports whether it is currently at the top edge for vertical
  sheet handoff
- Native code rejects only downward vertical drags when content is already at
  top, allowing the native sheet gesture to take over for dismiss / detent
  motion

Current minimal bridge:

- `gpui_ios_inject_scroll(...)` forwards native deltas into the embedded iOS GPUI window
- `zedra_ios_sheet_content_is_at_top()` exposes the active sheet content boundary
- Android calls `nativeSheetContentIsAtTop()` from `SheetHostView` for the same
  boundary check.

Current content participation:

- sheet-hosted content exposes its own top-edge state
- the sheet wrapper publishes the active content boundary to the native bridge

GPUI layout requirement:

- the hosted GPUI viewport must be explicitly height-constrained
- use `size_full()` on the sheet body viewport wrapper
- use `min_h_0()` on intermediate flex children between the sheet host and the scrollable GPUI node
- keep a stable `.id(...)` on the GPUI scroll node

Without that layout chain, GPUI can measure the scroll node at content height, which makes the native scroll bridge appear wired up while inner scrolling still does not move.

This contract is intentionally minimal:

- native -> GPUI: two-dimensional scroll delta + phase
- GPUI -> native: top-edge boolean

Do not add a broader bidirectional gesture abstraction unless more sheet content
types need it.

## Runtime model

The custom sheet should feel instant.

- do not create a fresh GPUI sheet window on every open
- keep one embedded GPUI sheet window alive per platform runtime
- detach and reattach its native `GPUIMetalView` / Android `SurfaceView`
  between sheet presentations
- force the first frame immediately after attach, then continue normal frame driving

Reusing only the renderer context is not enough. Reuse the embedded GPUI window/view too.

## Shared state

The main app and the sheet content run inside the same GPUI app runtime.

- shared app state should live in an app-owned `Entity<T>`
- the main window and sheet window should both receive that same entity handle
- sheet content should not fork its own duplicate state if it needs to reflect live app state

Current custom sheet content reads shared state from the main app, then renders that state inside the native sheet host.

## Routing actions back to the workspace

Sheet content runs in a detached window, so its actions and events do not bubble
to the main window's `Workspace`. Route back through the `ActiveWorkspace`
ambient global instead of threading a `WeakEntity<Workspace>` through every sheet
owner.

- `ActiveWorkspace` (`crates/zedra/src/workspace.rs`) holds the foreground
  workspace's weak handle. `Workspaces` keeps it in sync after every
  `active_index` change via `sync_active_workspace`.
- Sheet content resolves the target with `ActiveWorkspace::get(cx)` and calls the
  workspace method directly (window-agnostic), e.g. the file-preview sheet reads
  its own window's read-only selection and routes "Add to Chat" through
  `Workspace::present_add_to_chat`.
- Anything genuinely window-bound (clearing the read-only selection cache) stays
  on the sheet side; only the window-free workspace action crosses over.

This keeps detached surfaces workspace-aware without per-owner plumbing, so new
sheets (file preview from terminal links or agent-detail files, future surfaces)
reach the workspace the same way.

## Practical rule

Use native components for native behavior.

- alerts and selections: fully native
- in-app notifications: native bubble stack
- floating icon buttons: GPUI wrapper for position/lifecycle/callback, native
  chrome
- custom sheet: native shell + GPUI content
- QR scanner / dictation preview: separate native flows unless we intentionally generalize them
