# Clean-Code Policy

## Purpose and scope

This policy governs project-specific naming, structure, module-boundary,
and readability rules. It defines the expectations for function, class,
module, and file scope and responsibility; the limits on dead code and
premature extensibility; the error-handling and logging conventions; the
rules for refactoring code that cannot be tested or understood cleanly;
and the treatment of generated, vendored, migration, and compatibility
code.

## Default requirements

* The agent MUST follow project-specific naming conventions verified
  against existing source. Generic style guides do NOT override the
  project's actual convention.
* The agent MUST prefer simple, maintainable solutions and existing
  project patterns over speculative abstractions or duplicated helpers.
  New abstractions require demonstrated boundary, volatility, testing, or
  reuse value; implementation count alone neither requires nor forbids one.
* Dead code, commented-out code, unused compatibility layers, and
  unused imports MUST be removed. The "we might need it later"
  rationale does not override the no-dead-code rule.
* Functions, classes, modules, and files MUST remain cohesive, expose
  understandable interfaces, and have bounded reasons to change.
* Error handling MUST surface actionable context. Bare `except: pass` is
  forbidden. Handle or propagate errors according to project convention;
  log once at the owning handling boundary and redact sensitive context.
* Test friction MUST prompt investigation. Refactor only when it reveals a
  real cohesion, dependency, or I/O-seam problem; do not create an artificial
  public seam solely for a test.
* Generated and vendored code MUST be identifiable and MAY be excluded from
  generic checks with a documented reason. First-party migration and
  compatibility code remain subject to applicable quality gates.
* Cross-component dependency direction, state ownership, and external I/O
  boundaries are governed by `architecture-policy.md`.

## Project facts to resolve

The `RALPH-FACT:` lines below record verified project facts. Agents rely
on them when enforcing this policy and MUST keep them current as the
project evolves.

<!-- REPLACE-ME: record one verified, machine-checkable value per fact
below (commands, paths, names, versions — not adjectives or aspirations).
If a fact cannot be resolved yet (project too young, tool not chosen, value
not knowable), defer it with the RALPH-PENDING form "RALPH-PENDING (assumed
<date>); review trigger: <trigger>" — it reaches readiness and a dev-cycle
agent resolves it when its trigger fires. Then
delete this comment. -->

## AI execution instructions

To follow this policy, an agent making any change MUST:

* PREFER existing project utilities and patterns over new abstractions.
* REMOVE dead code in the same change that obsoletes it.
* RECORD the clean-code review evidence appropriate to the change,
  covering the judgment a dead-code audit cannot: naming, cohesion,
  interface clarity, and abstraction justification.
* RUN every `RALPH-COMMAND:` gate declared under Verification before
  claiming the change complies, and report the actual outcome. Never
  report a command that was not run.
* UPDATE this policy (facts, commands, requirements) in the same
  workflow that changes the naming convention, module boundary rules,
  or error-handling and logging conventions.

An agent MUST NOT:

* Introduce speculative abstractions ("we might need it later").
* Add unused compatibility layers.
* Weaken the no-dead-code rule to obtain a passing result.

## Verification

Run every gate below before claiming a change complies with this policy.

<!-- REPLACE-ME: the RALPH-COMMAND gate covers only the mechanically
checkable slice — the dead-code / unused-import audit named in
`dead_code_audit_command`. Its first token must be an approved gate tool
(wrap anything else in `make`, `uv run`, or `npx`); if no such audit exists
yet, create the smallest real one rather than a hollow command, or record a
technically justified RALPH-INAPPLICABLE line. Naming, cohesion, interface
clarity, and abstraction judgment are not script-checkable — they are carried
by the separate RALPH-REVIEW line, which you must always resolve. Then delete
this comment. -->

RALPH-COMMAND: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-REVIEW: review naming, cohesion, interface clarity, abstraction justification, and error/logging conventions against verified project convention; evidence: dated clean-code review or explicit not-performed blocker; owner: code quality owner

The command gate's expected successful result is a clean dead-code audit;
report any audit findings. The review gate certifies the judgment the audit
cannot.

## Exceptions

A documented exception (e.g. legacy compatibility shim with a removal
date) requires a documented rationale, scope, owner, and removal or
review date.

## Maintenance triggers

This policy MUST be reviewed in the same workflow as any of:

* A new naming convention is introduced.
* A new module boundary rule is introduced.
* The error-handling or logging convention changes.
* A new generated/vendored code category is added.

## Living document contract

This policy is a living document. It MUST evolve as the project grows:
update the resolved facts, commands, and requirements whenever verified
project reality changes (new frameworks, new commands, new structure).
Two guardrails bound every amendment:

* Conflicts between this policy's generic defaults and the project's
  established practice are resolved in
  favor of the existing project policy — adapt this file to verified
  project reality, never the reverse. A looser project practice is
  NOT such a conflict: keep the stronger requirement unless a
  documented exception narrows it.
* An amendment MUST NOT subvert the INTENT of this policy. Weakening,
  disabling, or deleting a requirement so that a failing change passes is
  forbidden; evolution clarifies and extends, it does not water down.
