# Architecture Policy

## Purpose and scope

This policy governs component boundaries, dependency direction, state
ownership, external I/O, and durable contracts. It records this project's
architecture without imposing a named pattern or directory layout.

## Default requirements

* Dependencies MUST follow a documented direction; cycles across declared
  architectural components and forbidden cross-boundary imports are prohibited.
* Domain decisions MUST remain separable from delivery frameworks and external
  I/O where the project has such distinctions.
* Mutable state, transactions, concurrency, caches, and background work MUST
  have explicit owners and lifecycles.
* Public APIs, CLI behavior, protocols, schemas, and persisted formats MUST be
  treated as compatibility boundaries when consumers depend on them.
* New abstractions MUST solve a demonstrated boundary, volatility, testing, or
  reuse need; implementation count alone neither requires nor forbids an
  abstraction.
* Material, hard-to-reverse architectural decisions MUST be recorded durably.
* Architecture MUST be evaluated against explicit quality-attribute scenarios,
  stakeholder needs, operational context, and known tradeoffs rather than a
  preferred pattern in isolation.
* Relevant static, runtime, deployment, interface, and data-flow views MUST be
  documented when those views affect design or operation.

## AI execution instructions

Agents MUST inspect the component map before moving responsibilities, preserve
dependency direction, update affected decision records, and remove superseded
architecture rather than leaving parallel paths. Agents MUST identify affected
quality attributes, runtime/data-flow views, and tradeoffs before claiming an
architectural change is fit. Agents MUST run declared commands, perform
declared reviews, report unavailable evidence as a blocker, and update changed
facts. Agents MUST NOT invent components, decisions, quality targets, or review
evidence.

## Verification

<!-- REPLACE-ME: declare an executable architecture/import/contract command
when available; otherwise use a technically justified RALPH-INAPPLICABLE line.
Always resolve the separate RALPH-REVIEW. Then delete this comment. -->

RALPH-COMMAND: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-REVIEW: evaluate quality scenarios, views, boundaries, risks, and tradeoffs; evidence: dated architecture review or explicit blocker; owner: architecture owner

Success means no forbidden dependency, cycle, boundary violation, or unreviewed
contract break.

## Exceptions

An exception requires scope, rationale, owner, and a removal or review trigger.

## Maintenance triggers

Review this policy when components, dependency direction, state ownership,
external boundaries, or durable contracts change.

## Living document contract

This is a living document. Verified project facts determine implementation
details; mandatory outcomes remain unless narrowed by a scoped, owner-approved,
expiring exception. Stronger legal, contractual, security, or safety
obligations win.
