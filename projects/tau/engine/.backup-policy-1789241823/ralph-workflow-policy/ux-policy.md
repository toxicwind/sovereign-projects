<!-- RALPH-STARTER-TEMPLATE: this file is a starter template, not yet this
project's policy. A remediation agent rewrites it with verified project
facts (every RALPH-FACT and RALPH-COMMAND below), adapts the defaults to the
project's established practice, and deletes this banner. Readiness stays
blocked while this banner or any placeholder token remains. -->

# UX Policy

This policy applies while the project ships substantial UI (an app
framework or client-side routing). UX obligations imply the
design-system policy; a single incidental control or a minimal
admin page is out of scope. If the project permanently stops
shipping substantial UI, remove this policy file in the same
workflow.

## Purpose and scope

This policy governs user experience: target users, primary tasks,
established interaction principles, navigation and information
architecture, expected states (loading, empty, error, validation,
success, disabled, permission), form behaviour, focus and keyboard
interaction, responsive behaviour, destructive-action consistency, and
UX review evidence. It applies to every change that affects user flows,
interaction behaviour, or usability.

## Default requirements

* The agent MUST identify target users, primary tasks, and established
  interaction principles before any UX change.
* Navigation and information-architecture conventions MUST be
  consistent across the application.
* Loading, empty, error, validation, success, disabled, and permission
  states MUST follow the established pattern.
* Forms MUST follow the established pattern: labels, validation
  feedback, focus management, keyboard interaction, and accessibility.
* Destructive operations MUST use a risk-appropriate safeguard such as
  confirmation, undo, soft deletion, version history, delayed execution,
  or an explicit non-interactive override, following the established pattern.
* Terminology, actions, and confirmations MUST be consistent across the
  application.
* UX changes MUST be evaluated against existing patterns and user
  needs. UX review evidence MUST be proportionate to the change.

## Project facts to resolve

The `RALPH-FACT:` lines below record verified project facts. Agents rely
on them when enforcing this policy and MUST keep them current as the
project evolves.

<!-- REPLACE-ME: record one verified, machine-checkable value per fact
below (commands, paths, names, versions — not adjectives or aspirations).
If a fact cannot be resolved yet (project too young, tool not chosen, value
not knowable), defer it with the RALPH-PENDING form "RALPH-PENDING (assumed
<date>); review trigger: <trigger>" — it reaches readiness and a dev-cycle
agent resolves it when its trigger fires. Then
delete this comment. -->

## AI execution instructions

To follow this policy, an agent making any change MUST:

* PREFER existing UX patterns over new patterns.
* RECORD the UX review evidence appropriate to the change.
* RUN every `RALPH-COMMAND:` gate declared under Verification before
  claiming the change complies, and report the actual outcome. Never
  report a command that was not run.
* UPDATE this policy (facts, commands, requirements) in the same
  workflow that changes the navigation, form, state, or
  destructive-action pattern.

An agent MUST NOT:

* Introduce inconsistent terminology or destructive-action patterns.
* Skip a relevant empty, error, loading, validation, permission, or success
  state. An unreachable state may be recorded as inapplicable with a reason.

## Verification

Run every gate below before claiming a change complies with this policy.

<!-- REPLACE-ME: set the project's real gate command. The first token must
be an approved gate tool (wrap anything else in `make`, `uv run`, or
`npx`). If the project has no such gate yet, create the smallest real one
(a make target running the actual check) rather than declaring a hollow
command; a gate that applies but is not wired yet (for example the tool is
not installed on a new project) is recorded as a RALPH-PENDING deferral —
`RALPH-PENDING: <approved-tool> (assumed <date>); review trigger: <trigger>`
— which reaches readiness and is resolved by a later dev cycle when its
trigger fires; only a gate that truly cannot EVER exist is recorded as
inapplicable with a reason and the condition that would create it. Then
delete this comment. -->

RALPH-COMMAND: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-REVIEW: exercise affected flows and relevant states with representative users or proxies; evidence: dated UX review or explicit not-performed blocker; owner: product UX owner

The expected successful result is exit 0 from the UX review / audit.
On failure, report the affected screen and the gap.

## Exceptions

A documented UX exception (e.g. a wizard flow that diverges from the
default) requires a documented rationale, scope, owner, and review
date.

## Maintenance triggers

This policy MUST be reviewed in the same workflow as any of:

* A new screen, flow, or navigation pattern is added.
* The form or state pattern changes.
* The destructive-action pattern changes.

## Living document contract

This policy is a living document. It MUST evolve as the project grows:
update the resolved facts, commands, and requirements whenever verified
project reality changes (new frameworks, new commands, new structure).
Two guardrails bound every amendment:

* Conflicts between this policy's generic defaults and the project's
  established practice are resolved in
  favor of the existing project policy — adapt this file to verified
  project reality, never the reverse. A looser project practice is
  NOT such a conflict: keep the stronger requirement unless a
  documented exception narrows it.
* An amendment MUST NOT subvert the INTENT of this policy. Weakening,
  disabling, or deleting a requirement so that a failing change passes is
  forbidden; evolution clarifies and extends, it does not water down.

## Ralph markers

* Policy id: `<!-- ralph-policy-id: ux-policy.md -->`
* Schema version: `<!-- ralph-policy-schema: v3 -->`

## Visual review authority

Criterion 8 verdict authority: a capture-backed criterion 8 verdict is agent-produced evidence and does not close the design review lane; the named human review verdict remains required. UX policy aligns with the design-system policy on this point.

Appearance assertions about CSS, classes, styles, or DOM structure remain adjacent implementation checks; they do not close a visual criterion.

RALPH-FACT: visual_verdict_artifact: design_verdict
RALPH-FACT: visual_capture_handle: ralph://media/{artifact_id}
RALPH-FACT: design_capture_command: <declared capture command from the design-system policy>

An appearance assertion (CSS/class/style/DOM) is NOT evidence of design quality. Design proof requires captures graded visually via the criterion 8 verdict.
