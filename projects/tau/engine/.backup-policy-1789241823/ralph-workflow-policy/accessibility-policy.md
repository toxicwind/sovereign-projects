# Accessibility Policy

## Purpose and scope

This policy governs functional accessibility for user-facing interfaces.

## Applicability

Required for project-owned web, graphical, or interactive UI. Record platform,
conformance scope, and exclusions; uncertainty requires owner confirmation. If
the surface disappears, retain the file with a dated inactive decision and
reactivation trigger, or remove it through reviewed policy cleanup.

## Default requirements

* Semantic structure, names, roles, states, focus order, keyboard operation,
  contrast, zoom, motion preferences, and error identification MUST be
  addressed where applicable.
* Applicable text alternatives, captions, reflow, target size, status messages,
  timing, flashing, language, and accessible authentication criteria MUST be
  included in the declared conformance scope.
* Automated checks MUST complement, not replace, keyboard and
  assistive-technology review of material flows.
* New UI MUST meet the project's declared accessibility standard and MUST NOT
  introduce regressions.

## Project facts to resolve

## AI execution instructions

Agents MUST reuse accessible components and select material flows by user
criticality, interaction novelty, and regression risk. Test representative
supported platform/input/assistive-technology combinations when the platform
supports them; otherwise inspect platform accessibility APIs and document the
limitation. Agents MUST run declared commands and reviews, identify the tested
platform and flow, and report manual capability that was not available. Agents
MUST NOT claim assistive-technology evidence that was not performed.

RALPH-COMMAND: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-REVIEW: exercise affected keyboard and assistive-technology flows; evidence: dated accessibility review including not-performed blockers; owner: accessibility owner

## Exceptions

Exceptions require affected users, impact, mitigation, owner, and review date.

## Maintenance triggers

Review when the UI framework, component library, accessibility standard, or
primary interaction pattern changes.

## Living document contract

This is a living document. Verified project facts determine implementation
details; mandatory outcomes remain unless narrowed by a scoped, owner-approved,
expiring exception. Stronger legal, contractual, security, or safety
obligations win.

## Adjacent visual audits

Accessibility audits are adjacent to a visual criterion and never close a criterion 8 verdict. The verdict authority is owned by the criterion 8 conditions named in the visual-verification ADR and the design-system policy.

Accessibility passes may still be required work in their own right; their green reports never replace a visual verdict.

## Visual review authority

An appearance assertion (CSS/class/style/DOM) is NOT evidence of design quality. Design proof requires captures graded visually via the criterion 8 verdict. Criterion 8 verdict authority: a capture-backed criterion 8 verdict is agent-produced evidence and does not close the design review lane; the named human review verdict remains required.
