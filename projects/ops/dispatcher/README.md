# Fleet dispatcher/ledger (canonical)

`projects/ops/dispatcher/` — the canonical dispatcher and audit ledger for
Chris's agent fleet. One place that answers: **who was admitted to do what,
what happened, what got built, and who overrode whom.**

## What it is

- **ID issuance** — `mission` / `coordinator` / `worker` / `relay` IDs,
  atomic across processes (flock counters, O_EXCL relay claims).
- **Lifecycle + result tracking** — `admitted → running → stalled → completed | failed | killed`,
  with results carrying success flags, summaries, artifacts, and commit SHAs.
- **direct-Chris precedence** — standing rule, enforced in code:
  `chris-direct` (100) preempts `coordinator` (50), `oracle` (40), `agent` (10).
- **Duplicate-admission locks** — a dedup key admits exactly once while its
  lock is live; stale locks are reclaimed, lower-precedence retries are
  refused fail-closed.
- **Append-only relay records** — each relay owns a hash-chained
  `records.jsonl`; writers only append, readers never mutate.
- **Artifact/commit aggregation** — per-result artifact + SHA registration
  (SHAs validated), mission-level manifests.
- **Automatic relay archival** — a worker/coordinator's relay seals the
  moment its result is recorded. No timers, no sweeps needed;
  `archive-sweep` exists only as idempotent repair.
- **Exactly-four-audit-lanes enforcement** — the ledger writer rejects any
  lane outside the canonical four, fail-closed.

## The four audit lanes

| Lane | Records | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `dispatch` | admissions, assignments, intake decisions/refusals/duplicates | who was told to do what |
| `lifecycle` | transitions, results, relay seals | what happened over time |
| `artifact` | artifact + commit registrations, mission manifests | what got built, where it lives |
| `governance` | lock acquired/refused/preempted/reclaimed, chris-direct overrides, relay archival | who overrode whom, why work was refused |

`Ledger.append(lane, ...)` raises `LaneViolation` for anything else.
`dispatch audit` replays every chain and re-checks every lane.

## ID scheme

```
mission:     m-<slug>-<yyyymmdd>-<seq>     m-dispatcher-20260921-001
coordinator: c-<name>-<seq>                c-pack-keeper-004
worker:      w-<name>-<seq>                w-stall-slayer-012
relay:       relay-<agent-name>             relay-stall-slayer
             (re-entrant name → relay-<name>-2, claimed atomically)
```

IDs are unique, not gapless: a refused duplicate admission mints an ID and
then refuses it, burning one counter step. The ID is never registered
(no entity file, no ledger record), so gaps are harmless by design.

## State layout

```
projects/ops/dispatcher/state/        ← runtime state, gitignored
  ledger.jsonl                          fleet ledger (hash-chained)
  entities/<entity-id>.json             one file per mission/coordinator/worker
  locks/<sha1(dedup)>.lock              admission locks (heartbeated)
  counters/*.ctr                        flock-guarded ID counters
  relay-claims/relay-<name>             atomic relay claims
  relays/<relay-id>/records.jsonl      relay's own hash-chained log
  relays/<relay-id>/summary.json        written once at seal
  relays/archive.jsonl                  global archival index
```

Everything is files. Kill the process, reboot the box, construct a new
`Dispatcher` on the same dir — IDs continue, locks hold, the ledger chain
continues. There is no in-memory state that matters and no daemon to restart.

## CLI

```bash
bin/dispatch --state <dir> admit-mission --slug dispatcher \
  --origin chris-direct --brief "build the ledger"
bin/dispatch admit-worker --name stall-slayer --mission m-dispatcher-20260921-001 \
  --origin coordinator --brief "forensics" --coordinator c-pack-keeper-004
bin/dispatch transition --id w-stall-slayer-012 --to running
bin/dispatch result --id w-stall-slayer-012 --success true --summary "done" \
  --artifact projects/ops/stall-detect/queries.sql --commit 0eb76b496d
bin/dispatch status [--id w-stall-slayer-012]
bin/dispatch manifest --mission m-dispatcher-20260921-001
bin/dispatch audit            # verify all chains + lanes; exit 1 on break
bin/dispatch archive-sweep    # idempotent repair for unsealed terminal relays
bin/dispatch intake --from ember --text "probe herd health" --origin agent
```

Exit codes: 0 ok · 3 duplicate-admission · 4 unknown-entity ·
5 illegal-transition · 6 bad-request.

## Intake hook

`intake_submit({"from","text","origin"})` is the admission endpoint for the
oracle front door (see lane-oracle-connector): non-empty requests become
missions deduped on text hash; empties are refused; repeats report the
existing holder. Full triage (TASK/DEBATE/RESEARCH/…) stays in
`agents/oracle-market/bin/oracle_intake.py` — this is the dispatch side.

## Boundaries (borrowed, not duplicated)

- `tools/sovereign-chat/dispatch.ts` — sovereign-chat's **internal** lease
  queue (bun:sqlite, wedge semantics). Task-level, inside the chat process.
  This dispatcher is fleet-mission level, above it.
- `fleet/dispatch_fallback.py` — client-side fallback that queues dispatch
  frames to the directives file when the chat server is unreachable.
  Complementary transport, not a ledger.
- `agents/oracle-market/` — the oracle market loop: task bidding, intake
  triage, bidder workers. Its `bin/oracle_loop.py` tracks market tasks;
  this dispatcher tracks fleet missions/coordinators/workers and their relays.
  The intake hook above is the seam between them.

## Tests

```bash
cd projects/ops/dispatcher && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Stdlib only. Covers: ID uniqueness (incl. 8-thread races), relay claim
races, duplicate-admission (incl. 12-thread race), chris-direct preemption,
stale-lock reclaim, four-lane enforcement, chain tamper detection,
read-only readers, full worker lifecycle, illegal transitions, stall
recovery, SHA validation, manifest aggregation, archive-sweep repair,
intake dedup, and restart continuity (new `Dispatcher`, same dir).

## Durability

- No daemons, no timers, no polling — the CLI runs on events; heartbeats
  are caller-driven.
- Restart test: `tests/test_dispatcher.py::TestRestart` proves a fresh
  process continues IDs, locks, and the ledger chain on the same state dir.
- Survives full yote reboot: state is on disk under `state/` (gitignored
  runtime state, like `bg-tracker/state/`); code + tests are committed.
