"""fleet_dispatch — canonical dispatcher/ledger for Chris's agent fleet.

Mission/coordinator/worker/relay ID issuance, lifecycle + result tracking,
duplicate-admission locks, direct-Chris precedence, append-only hash-chained
relay records, artifact/commit aggregation, automatic relay archival, and
exactly-four-audit-lanes enforcement.

Everything is file-based (JSONL + lock files) under a state dir so it
survives process restarts and full box reboots with zero in-memory state.
No daemons, no timers: the CLI is invoked on events (admission, transition,
completion); heartbeats are caller-driven.

Canonical home: projects/ops/dispatcher/ in toxicwind/sovereign-projects.
