> **Mesh context.** This directory is the vendored source of [smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go) — the engine behind **shep**, which fronts 30 upstream MCP servers on the mesh. The sovereign deployment is configured in `sovereign-projects/mesh/gateway/mcp_config.json` and runs as the pitchfork `shep` daemon on `:25127`. Vendored code tracks upstream; keep local diffs minimal so re-vends stay clean.

> The demo above shows the **embedded web UI**. The MCPProxy **core is a single binary for macOS, Linux, and Windows** — the web UI ships inside it, with no extra service to run. On **macOS**, an optional **menu-bar app** adds one-click convenience (start/stop, server health, quarantine, logs).

## Why MCPProxy?

- **Scale beyond API limits** – Federate hundreds of MCP servers while bypassing Cursor's 40-tool limit and OpenAI's 128-function cap.
- **Save tokens & accelerate responses** – Agents load just one `retrieve_tools` function instead of hundreds of schemas. Research shows ~99 % token reduction with **43 % accuracy improvement**.
- **Advanced security protection** – Automatic quarantine blocks Tool Poisoning Attacks until you manually approve new servers.
- **Pluggable security scanners** – Run Snyk, Semgrep, Trivy, Cisco, and other Docker-based scanners against quarantined servers before you approve them; findings are normalized to SARIF with a composite risk score. See [Security scanner plugins](https://docs.mcpproxy.app/features/security-scanner-plugins/).
- **Works offline & cross-platform** – A single core binary for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows (x64 & ARM64), and Linux (x64 & ARM64), with the **web UI embedded**. macOS additionally ships an optional menu-bar app.

```

In the sovereign deployment, agents see a handful of built-in MCPProxy tools instead of hundreds of upstream schemas. Shep's config (`mcp_config.json`) declares the 30 upstream servers; the quarantine gate holds new servers until approved; BM25 `retrieve_tools` keeps agent context small. The reproducible numbers behind the token-reduction claims are measured by `bench/` — see [bench/README.md](bench/README.md).

## How AI Agents Work Through MCPProxy

Once connected, your agent sees a handful of built-in MCPProxy tools instead of hundreds of upstream schemas. A typical session has three beats — discover, call, audit — plus an optional preflight gate for unattended automations.

### 1. Discover — spend one query, not your context window

The agent asks for what it needs in plain keywords via `retrieve_tools`:

```json
{ "query": "create github issue", "limit": 5 }
```

MCPProxy runs a BM25 search across every connected server and returns only the top-ranked matches — each with a `call_with` hint recommending the right call variant for its annotations:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    { "name": "github:create_issue", "score": 0.89, "call_with": "call_tool_write" },
    { "name": "gitlab:create_issue", "score": 0.72, "call_with": "call_tool_write" }
  ]
}
```

This is where the token savings come from: the schemas of the hundreds of tools the agent *didn't* need never enter its context. The agent loads full schemas on demand with `describe_tool` (batch up to 5 ids) only for the tools it's about to use.

### 2. Call — with declared intent

The agent executes the tool through the variant matching its intent (`call_tool_read`, `call_tool_write`, or `call_tool_destructive`), addressing it as `server:tool`:

```json
{
  "name": "github:create_issue",
  "args_json": "{\"repo\": \"acme/api\", \"title\": \"Bug report\"}",
  "intent": { "operation_type": "write", "reason": "Filing bug per user request" }
}
```

MCPProxy validates the intent against the tool's annotations (a "read" call can't reach a destructive tool), checks quarantine and approval state, and scans arguments and responses for sensitive data before anything leaves the machine.

### 3. Audit — every call is on the record

Every call lands in the local [Activity Log](https://docs.mcpproxy.app/features/activity-log/) with a request ID, so you can reconstruct exactly what an agent did:

```bash
mcpproxy activity list                          # everything, newest first
mcpproxy activity list --request-id <id>        # one workflow, correlated
```

### Gate automations before they burn tokens

For recurring headless jobs (cron, CI, n8n), don't let the agent discover a missing tool the expensive way. One preflight command checks that every required tool is ready — without contacting any upstream server — and reports exactly why when it isn't (server quarantined, tool changed since approval, OAuth expired, typo'd id):

```bash
mcpproxy tools preflight gh-ops:sync_issues slack:post_message --wait 10s
case $? in
  0)  run-agent-session ;;   # all ready — go
  10) exit 75 ;;             # transient (server starting) — let the next cron tick retry
  11) page-operator ;;        # blocked — someone must approve / enable / log in
  12) fail-pipeline ;;       # unknown tool id — the automation itself is misconfigured
esac
```

See [Required-Tools Preflight](https://docs.mcpproxy.app/features/tools-preflight/) for the full reason taxonomy, REST endpoint, and GitHub Actions / n8n recipes.

## 🔐 Optional HTTPS Setup

MCPProxy works with HTTP by default for easy setup. HTTPS is optional and primarily useful for production environments or when stricter security is required.

### Quick HTTPS Setup

**1. Enable HTTPS** (choose one method):
```bash
# Method 1: Environment variable
export MCPPROXY_TLS_ENABLED=true
mcpproxy serve

# Method 2: Config file
# Edit ~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json and set "tls.enabled": true
```

**2. Trust the certificate** (one-time setup):
```bash
mcpproxy trust-cert
```

**3. Use HTTPS URLs**:
- MCP endpoint: `https://localhost:8080/mcp`
- Web UI: `https://localhost:8080/ui/`

### Certificate Management

- **Automatic generation**: Certificates created on first HTTPS startup
- **Multi-domain support**: Works with `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`
- **Trust installation**: Use `mcpproxy trust-cert` to add to system keychain
- **Certificate location**: `~/.mcpproxy/certs/` (ca.pem, server.pem, server-key.pem)

### Troubleshooting HTTPS

```bash
mcpproxy trust-cert --force   # re-trust certificate
ls ~/.mcpproxy/certs/         # check certificate location
curl -k https://localhost:8080/api/v1/status   # test HTTPS connection
```

## Dev / contributing

We welcome issues, feature ideas, and PRs! (Upstream: contribute to [smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go); mesh-local fixes go to the sovereign-projects repo with minimal local diffs.)

### Development Setup

```bash
make dev-setup                # Install swag, frontend deps, Playwright
brew install prek             # Install pre-commit hook runner (or: uv tool install prek)
prek install                  # Install pre-commit hooks
prek install --hook-type pre-push  # Install pre-push hooks
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) to catch issues before they reach CI:

| Hook | Stage | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `gofmt` | pre-commit | Auto-formats staged Go files |
| `trailing-whitespace` | pre-commit | Removes trailing whitespace |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | pre-commit | Ensures files end with newline |
| `check-merge-conflict` | pre-commit | Detects merge conflict markers |
| `swagger-verify` | pre-push | Fails if OpenAPI spec is out of date |
| `go-build` | pre-push | Verifies the project compiles |

Run hooks manually: `prek run --all-files`

### Build & Test

```bash
make build          # Build frontend + backend
make swagger        # Regenerate OpenAPI spec
make test           # Unit tests
make test-e2e       # E2E tests
make lint           # Run linters
```
