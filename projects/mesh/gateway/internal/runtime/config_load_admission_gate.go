// Issue #937 — the trust-mode admission gate on the CONFIG-LOAD path.
//
// Before this, Config.QuarantineDefaultForServer() was invoked from exactly
// three ADD-time sites (registry add, the upstream_servers MCP tool, the REST
// handler). A server written straight into mcp_config.json reached the upstream
// manager without passing any of them: it was admitted unquarantined, its tools
// auto-approved, and a poisoned tool description served verbatim to agents —
// under the DEFAULT `manual` trust mode with quarantine_enabled:true. That
// contradicts the trust-mode table published in
// docs/features/security-quarantine.md, which states that `manual` means
// "Quarantined for human review".
//
// # What is gated
//
// A server is gated only when ALL of these hold:
//
//   - config.db was readable (see "Storage failures" below), AND
//   - the parsed config document never stated a `quarantined` value
//     (ServerConfig.QuarantineExplicitlySet() — an operator who wrote the key,
//     either way, has spoken and is obeyed), AND
//   - the server is not yet known to config.db.
//
// # The upgrade boundary (deliberate, and the reason for the last condition)
//
// "Not yet known to config.db" is the proxy for "has never been through
// admission". Every server an existing user is running already has a config.db
// record, so an upgrade re-quarantines nothing — which is the whole point:
// a server the user has already vetted must not suddenly disappear behind a
// quarantine wall on a version bump.
//
// The cost of that choice is that an install ALREADY hit by #937 keeps its
// poisoned server live, because the buggy admission left exactly the config.db
// record this gate reads as "vetted". Nothing distinguishes the two at load
// time, so instead of guessing, reportPreFixAdmissions below names those
// servers in a WARN so an operator can review them. See the "Upgrading" section
// of docs/features/security-quarantine.md.
//
// The other boundary is precise and worth stating: a server that is in a
// hand-written config but NOT in config.db is treated as first-seen. That is
// true after `rm -rf ~/.mcpproxy/*.db`, or when a config file is moved to a
// machine whose data dir has never seen it — both of which are exactly the
// "config files get shared, templated, copied between machines" case the issue
// calls out, so gating them is the intended behaviour rather than a regression.
//
// # Storage failures
//
// A failed ListUpstreamServers() must NOT be flattened into "no servers are
// known" — that would make every configured server look first-seen and wall off
// the user's entire server list behind a quarantine, permanently, because the
// next boot would inherit the decision. A single bbolt lock contention at boot
// is not a security event. When storage is unreadable the gate abstains
// entirely: unknown is not the same as new.
//
// # Durability
//
// The gate decision is persisted by the caller's SaveUpstreamServer, and the
// second branch below re-reads it, so a config file that stays silent about
// `quarantined` inherits mcpproxy's own recorded state instead of resolving an
// absent key back to false.
//
// That durability depends on mcpproxy never FABRICATING an operator statement
// when it writes the config file. ServerConfig.MarshalJSON omits `quarantined`
// for a server that is not quarantined and never stated the key; without that,
// a single save (any `PUT /api/v1/config`) stamped `"quarantined": false` on
// every server, the presence check below skipped them forever, and the save
// loop in LoadConfiguredServers then wrote false over the config.db quarantine.
//
// # Immutability
//
// The gate NEVER writes through a *config.ServerConfig it was handed. Those
// pointers live in the snapshot published by configsvc, which the supervisor's
// reconcile loop and serverEligibleForIndexing read concurrently and which
// internal/server/server.go documents as immutable. A gated server is a COPY in
// a fresh Servers slice, and the caller republishes the whole config so
// subscribers observe the decision through an atomic snapshot swap.
//
// # Direction
//
// The gate can only ever ADD quarantine. Both branches are guarded on
// !sc.Quarantined, so a config (or an in-flight struct from an add path) that
// already asks for quarantine is never relaxed by a stale storage record.
// Un-quarantining stays exclusively a user action, which goes through
// Runtime.QuarantineServer and writes both stores.
//
// # Not done here
//
// No TPA scan runs at config-load admission. Quarantine-by-default already
// prevents the tools from reaching an agent, and the scan is what the human
// review step in the quarantine UI performs. Running a synchronous scan on the
// startup path would block boot on every first-seen server.

// admissionDecision is one server the gate wants to change, plus the activity
// text to publish once the decision has actually been committed.
