// Package limiter implements the bounded-concurrency admission control used by
// the upstream tool-call choke point (spec 093, GH #955).
//
// A Limiter caps the number of concurrently *running* calls in one scope (a
// single upstream server, or the proxy-wide aggregate) and parks excess calls
// in a bounded FIFO wait queue. Callers acquire with an absolute queue
// deadline that is shared across tiers (FR-004): waiting for a per-server slot
// and then for a global slot must never grant two full queue timeouts.
//
// A Limiter owns OCCUPANCY (how many calls are running, who is queued, whether
// the scope is retired) and nothing else. It never stores the limits themselves:
// those live in the registry's immutable published generation, and every
// admission decision is made against the values handed to it, so one admission
// can never combine one scope's new cap with another scope's old one (FR-021).
//
// Implementation note: the queue is a hand-rolled FIFO waiter list guarded by
// one mutex rather than golang.org/x/sync/semaphore. A semaphore's capacity is
// fixed at construction, but FR-021 requires occupancy to be *shared across
// generations* on hot reload — lowering a cap must not grant new capacity
// until the grandfathered running calls drain, and raising it must admit
// eligible waiters immediately. Both need a resizable cap over a live
// occupancy counter, which the waiter list gives us directly.
