// defaultQueueBudget is the wait budget used when a scope caps concurrency but
// publishes no queue_timeout. The config layer already defaults an active scope
// to 30s, so this only guards limits published directly (API, tests): a queued
// call must never wait without a deadline, which is the one way a saturated
// scope could park a caller indefinitely.
const defaultQueueBudget = 30 * time.Second

// Registry owns the live limiter instances: one per configured upstream server
// plus the proxy-wide aggregate. Readers take a whole GENERATION through one
// atomic pointer (no lock on the hot path); writers (config apply / hot reload)
// serialize on the registry mutex and republish the generation as a unit.
//
// Three invariants drive the shape of this type:
//
//   - FR-021, atomic publication: an admission must never combine one scope's
//     new settings with another scope's old ones, nor a new cap with a queue
//     deadline derived from an older generation. Everything an admission needs
//     — both limiter instances, both scopes' limits, and the resolved wait
//     budget — is resolved from ONE generation load, and the limits themselves
//     live only in generations. Publishing therefore cannot disturb an
//     admission already in flight: the new generation is stored first and the
//     wait queues are re-evaluated against it afterwards.
//
//   - FR-021, shared occupancy: limiter instances SURVIVE a reload (only the
//     limits are republished), and an instance exists for every eligible scope
//     even when that scope currently caps nothing. An unlimited scope still
//     counts its running calls, so enabling a cap later sees the calls already
//     in flight instead of starting from zero and admitting a second cap's
//     worth on top of them.
//
//   - FR-009, no admit-after-disable: retiring a server TOMBSTONES its entry
//     and the tombstone is never removed. Absence of a scope means "unlimited",
//     so absence must never be able to follow retirement — a caller that
//     resolved its client before the server was disabled can reach admission at
//     any later time, and it has to be refused, not waved through. Outstanding
//     holds drain into the retired instance; a server re-added under the same
//     name replaces the tombstone with a fresh instance, so the map holds at
//     most one entry per distinct server name the process has ever configured.
