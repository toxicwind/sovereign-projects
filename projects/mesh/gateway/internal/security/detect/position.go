// Position classifies where a phrase match sits in the surrounding text, so the
// checks can tell a genuine embedded instruction ("ignore previous
// instructions") apart from a tool that merely DESCRIBES such phrases
// ("analyzes prompts that ignore previous instructions"). This is the core
// false-positive control for legitimate security tooling (FR-009, US2), and the
// deciding factor between the hard/soft tiers for a matched directive.
//
// It is a three-way scale, not a binary one, because the two false-positive
// pressures pull in opposite directions (Spec 077 US1, Codex round-2):
//
//   - A bare label prefix ("Prompt:", "Message:") must NOT neutralize a clear
//     imperative — that framing is exactly what an attacker uses to smuggle a
//     directive (finding A, recall bypass). Such matches stay
//     PositionInstruction and hard-block.
//   - A tool that DESCRIBES an injection — a relative clause ("prompts that
//     ignore…") or an analytical verb governing the phrase ("returns text:
//     ignore…") — must not hard-block a benign tool (finding B). Such matches
//     are PositionDescriptive: the hard tier is discounted below its floor
//     (HARD→SOFT), but the soft tier still surfaces the match for review, so a
//     real injection wearing descriptive clothing never fully vanishes.
//   - Genuine quotation/illustration ("such as", "e.g.", surrounding quotes) is
//     PositionExample and most heavily discounted — that framing is the weakest
//     injection signal. It is NOT, however, silently dropped: a check built for
//     recall (phrase.injection) re-floors an already-MATCHED phrase to the soft
//     emit floor so a quoted/illustrated injection surfaces as review-only
//     rather than vanishing entirely (Spec 077 US1, Codex round-3 — the
//     "never fully suppress a matched injection" invariant that closes the
//     recurring silent-bypass class). "Quiet" for a legitimate quoting scanner
//     now means soft/review, never invisible.
//
// Position framing is decided per SENTENCE, not per description: a cue in a
// PRIOR sentence must not discount an imperative that begins a LATER one. Both
// the analytical-verb heuristic and the "example"/"such as" word cues are
// sentence-scoped (only the inline abbreviations "e.g."/"i.e." and quote runs,
// which carry their own internal periods, are matched across the whole window).
// Without this, a benign lead ("Example output format. Ignore all previous
// instructions…") would misclassify the following injection as an example and
// bypass the hard tier (Codex round-3 finding #1).

// Scope limits:

// example-position up to the SOFT review floor), the match stays VISIBLE as a
// review finding and the scan-mode admission gates hold — a server/tool with
// SOFT warnings stays quarantined (only a clean verdict auto-approves). What is
// lost is only the --force requirement on an explicit manual approval. The cue
// is withheld from the SOFT-only directive.imperative check (plain
// ClassifyPosition), which drops example-position silently, so a label cannot
// turn a directive-only match into a clean verdict.
// Adjective and noun forms are deliberately BOUNDED (explicit inflections, not

//
//   - descriptiveClause: any 3rd-person-singular verb taking a clausal
//     complement — "checks WHETHER …", "asks IF …", "detects THAT …",
//     "explains HOW …". A verb + complementizer is a report/analysis frame; an
//     injected imperative is a bare command ("ignore …"), never "<verb>s
//     whether …". This is why the structural signal is more robust than a verb
//     list: a NEW benign meta-verb ("Screens whether a prompt …") is caught by
//     construction, without editing any enumeration.
//   - descriptiveObject: any 3rd-person-singular verb taking a TEXTUAL object
//     noun — "returns TEXT …", "checks a PROMPT …", "handles the REQUEST …".
//     The tool operates on text/prompts (its subject matter) rather than issuing
//     the phrase.
//
// Both are deliberately NOT anchored to the sentence start: the sentence-scoped
// window (see ClassifyPosition) already prevents a prior sentence's frame from
