# Tasks: Proactive OAuth Token Refresh & UX Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-proactive-oauth-refresh/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests ARE requested per spec.md (unit tests, E2E tests, Playwright tests).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `internal/`, `cmd/mcpproxy/` at repository root
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Tests**: `internal/*_test.go`, `tests/`, `scripts/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and shared entities

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Proactive Refresh): Independent
  - US2 (CLI Logout): Depends on US1 TriggerOAuthLogout for RefreshManager notification
  - US3 (REST Logout): Depends on US2 management service method
  - US4-US6 (Web UI): Can run in parallel after US3
  - US7 (Expiration Display): Independent, low priority
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

```

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core structs before methods
- Internal implementation before public API
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T002, T003, T004, T005 can all run in parallel

**Foundational Phase**:
- T008, T009, T010, T011 (frontend) can run in parallel

**US1 Tests**:
- T012, T013, T014, T015, T016 can all run in parallel

**US2 Tests**:
- T031, T032, T033, T034 can all run in parallel

**US3 Tests**:
- T043, T044, T045 can all run in parallel

**US4/US5/US6 can run in parallel** after US3 completes

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for RefreshManager scheduleRefresh at 80% lifetime in internal/oauth/refresh_manager_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for RefreshManager retry with exponential backoff in internal/oauth/refresh_manager_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for RefreshManager stop on max retries in internal/oauth/refresh_manager_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for RefreshManager coordination with OAuthFlowCoordinator in internal/oauth/refresh_manager_test.go"
Task: "Unit test for RefreshManager OnTokenSaved and OnTokenCleared hooks in internal/oauth/refresh_manager_test.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Proactive Refresh)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (CLI Logout)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (REST Logout)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test proactive refresh and logout independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - core functionality complete

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test proactive refresh → Core value delivered
3. Add User Story 2-3 → Full logout capability
4. Add User Stories 4-6 → Complete Web UI experience
5. Add User Story 7 → Enhanced debugging capability

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Proactive Refresh)
   - Developer B: User Story 2-3 (Logout functionality)
3. After US3 completes:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Login Button Fix)
   - Developer B: User Story 5-6 (Logout Button + Badge)
4. Developer C: User Story 7 (Expiration Display)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Frontend tasks require `npm run build` to validate
- Backend tasks require `go test ./...` to validate
