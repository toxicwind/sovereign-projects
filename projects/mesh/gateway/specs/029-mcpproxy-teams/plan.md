# Implementation Plan: MCPProxy Repo Restructure (Personal + Teams Foundation)

**Branch**: `029-mcpproxy-teams` | **Date**: 2026-03-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/029-mcpproxy-teams/spec.md`

## Summary

Restructure the MCPProxy repository to support two editions (Personal and Teams) built from the same codebase using Go build tags. Personal is the default build; Teams requires `-tags server`. Add Dockerfile for teams, `native/` directory skeleton for future Swift/C# tray apps, extended Makefile, and edition self-identification.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.24 (toolchain go1.24.10), TypeScript 5.x / Vue 3.5 (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: Cobra (CLI), Chi (HTTP), BBolt (storage), Zap (logging), mcp-go (MCP), Vue 3 + Tailwind + DaisyUI (frontend)
**Storage**: BBolt database (`~/.mcpproxy/config.db`)
**Testing**: `go test`, `./scripts/test-api-e2e.sh`, Playwright (OAuth E2E), Vitest (frontend)
**Target Platform**: macOS (Personal DMG), Windows (Personal MSI), Linux (Personal tar.gz, Teams Docker/deb/tar.gz)
**Project Type**: web (Go backend + Vue frontend, embedded)
**Performance Goals**: No regression from current performance
**Constraints**: Zero behavior change for existing personal mode users (FR-037)
**Scale/Scope**: Foundation only — no teams feature logic, just the skeleton and build infrastructure

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Performance at Scale | PASS | No performance-affecting changes; restructure only |
| II. Actor-Based Concurrency | PASS | No concurrency changes |
| III. Configuration-Driven Architecture | PASS | Edition determined at build time, mode at config time |
| IV. Security by Default | PASS | Teams auth middleware added later; foundation is inert |
| V. Test-Driven Development | PASS | Tests for edition detection, build tag verification |
| VI. Documentation Hygiene | PASS | CLAUDE.md updated with new structure |

**Architecture Constraints**:
| Constraint | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Core + Tray Split | PASS | Tray split preserved; native/ skeleton added |
| Event-Driven Updates | PASS | No event changes |
| DDD Layering | PASS | internal/serveredition/ follows existing layer patterns |
| Upstream Client Modularity | PASS | No upstream changes |

.github/workflows/release.yml   # Modify: add teams build matrix entries
```

**Structure Decision**: Existing Go project structure preserved. Teams code isolated in `internal/serveredition/` with build tags. No `pkg/` migration. Native tray apps in `native/` at repo root.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. All changes follow existing patterns.
