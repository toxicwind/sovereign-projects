# Tasks: JavaScript Code Execution Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-code-execution/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), constitution check (passed)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US1, US2, US3, US8) should complete before P2 stories
  - P2 stories (US4-US7, US9-US10) can proceed in parallel after P1 complete
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**P1 Stories (MVP) - Complete in order**:
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Basic Multi-Tool Orchestration - FOUNDATIONAL for all other stories
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Error Handling - depends on US1 call_tool() implementation
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Execution Limits - depends on US1 Execute() function
- **US8 (Phase 6)**: Input/Output - depends on US1 runtime setup

**P2 Stories - Can start after MVP complete**:
- **US4 (Phase 7)**: Parallel Execution - depends on P1 complete (wraps Execute() with pool)
- **US5 (Phase 8)**: Configuration Toggle - depends on P1 complete (guards tool registration)
- **US6 (Phase 9)**: Observability - depends on P1 complete (adds logging to Execute())
- **US7 (Phase 10)**: LLM Guidance - depends on P1 complete (enhances tool description)
- **US9 (Phase 11)**: CLI Interface - depends on P1 complete (calls Execute() directly)
- **US10 (Phase 12)**: Documentation - depends on all features complete (documents everything)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Error types (errors.go) before runtime (runtime.go)
- Runtime before pool (pool.go)
- Pool before tool handler (mcp_code_execution.go)
- Tool handler before tool registration (mcp.go)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - All parallel**:
- T001, T002, T003, T004 (different directories)

**Phase 2 - Research tasks parallel, then config**:
- T005-T012 can all run in parallel (research documentation)
- T013 (errors.go)
- T014-T016 (config changes) depend on T013

**Phase 3 (US1) - Tests parallel, then models, then implementation**:
- T017-T020 (tests) can run in parallel
- T021-T022 (runtime.go basics) sequential
- T023-T026 (feature additions to runtime.go) can partially overlap if separate functions
- T027-T030 (tool handler and registration) sequential after runtime complete

**Phase 4-12 (Other user stories)**:
- All P2 stories can be worked on in parallel by different developers after P1 complete
- Within each story, tests can be written in parallel

**Phase 13 - Most tasks parallel**:
- T114-T120 can run in parallel (different concerns)
- T121-T124 performance tests can run in parallel
- T125-T127 final validation sequential

```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all US1 tests together (TDD - write before implementation):
Task T017: "Unit test: Execute simple JS returning value"
Task T018: "Unit test: Execute JS calling mock call_tool() once"
Task T019: "Unit test: Execute JS with loop calling call_tool() multiple times"
Task T020: "Integration test: code_execution tool with two mock upstream servers"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T016) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 Basic Orchestration (T017-T030)
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 Error Handling (T031-T039)
5. Complete Phase 5: US3 Execution Limits (T040-T050)
6. Complete Phase 6: US8 Input/Output (T051-T057)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
8. Run security tests (T114-T118)
9. **MVP READY** - Basic code_execution functional

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (P1 complete) → Test independently → Internal demo
2. Add US4 Parallel Execution → Test concurrency → Deploy to staging
3. Add US5 Configuration Toggle → Verify safe defaults → Production flag
4. Add US6 Observability → Monitor production usage
5. Add US7 LLM Guidance → Improve LLM behavior
6. Add US9 CLI Interface → Developer productivity boost
7. Add US10 Documentation → External documentation release
8. Phase 13 Polish → Production hardening
9. **FULL RELEASE**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after P1 complete:

1. **Team completes P1 together** (critical path)
2. **Split P2 stories** after MVP validated:
   - Developer A: US4 (Pool) + US5 (Config)
   - Developer B: US6 (Logs) + US7 (Docs)
   - Developer C: US9 (CLI) + US10 (Docs)
3. **Converge for Phase 13** (polish and validation)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- MVP = P1 stories complete (US1, US2, US3, US8) = ~57 tasks (T001-T057)
- Full feature = All phases complete = 127 tasks
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow constitution constraints: actor-based pool, config-driven, security-first
