# Tasks: Tool Annotations & MCP Sessions in WebUI

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-tool-annotations-webui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Following TDD principles per constitution - tests are included for core functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `internal/` at repository root (Go)
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/` (Vue 3 + TypeScript)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
  - US3 and US4 can start after Foundational (session storage available)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on session storage from Phase 2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on session storage from Phase 2

### Within Each User Story

- Backend changes before frontend changes
- Models/storage before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend components
- Core implementation before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (all parallel)**:
- T001-T010 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Foundational Phase**:
- T018 (tests) and T021 (route registration) and T024 (API tests) can run in parallel

**User Story 1**:
- T025 (runtime), T026 (httpapi), T027 (component) can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- T039 (SessionsTable) can run in parallel with backend tasks

**User Story 4**:
- T051 (SessionFilter) can run in parallel with backend tasks

## Parallel Example: Setup Phase

```bash
# Launch all type definition tasks together:
Task: "Add ToolAnnotation struct to internal/contracts/types.go"
Task: "Add MCPSession struct to internal/contracts/types.go"
Task: "Add Annotations field to Tool struct in internal/contracts/types.go"
Task: "Add Annotations field to ToolCallRecord struct in internal/contracts/types.go"
Task: "Add GetSessionsResponse DTO to internal/contracts/types.go"
Task: "Add GetSessionDetailResponse DTO to internal/contracts/types.go"

# Launch all frontend type tasks together:
Task: "Add ToolAnnotation interface to frontend/src/types/api.ts"
Task: "Add MCPSession interface to frontend/src/types/api.ts"
Task: "Add annotations field to Tool interface in frontend/src/types/api.ts"
Task: "Add annotations field to ToolCallRecord interface in frontend/src/types/api.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch backend and frontend work in parallel:
Task: "Propagate tool annotations from mcp-go SDK through tool listing in internal/runtime/runtime.go"
Task: "Include annotations in tool API responses in internal/httpapi/server.go"
Task: "Create AnnotationBadges.vue component in frontend/src/components/AnnotationBadges.vue"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (all type definitions)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (session storage + API)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (annotations on server details)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (compact annotations in history)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both annotation stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - annotations are fully functional

### Full Feature Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Annotations on details page
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Compact annotations in history
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Sessions dashboard table
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Session filtering
6. Complete Polish phase → Full feature complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Stories 1 & 2 (annotations - both P1)
   - Developer B: User Stories 3 & 4 (sessions - both P2)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution requires tests for core functionality (storage, API)
- Run linter before committing: `./scripts/run-linter.sh`
