# Tasks: OAuth E2E Testing & Observability

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-oauth-e2e-testing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature IS the test infrastructure. Tests are the primary deliverable.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md:
- Test server: `tests/oauthserver/`
- E2E scripts: `scripts/`
- Playwright tests: `e2e/playwright/`
- CLI enhancements: `cmd/mcpproxy/`
- Observability: `internal/oauth/`, `internal/management/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 + US2 are P1 priority - complete first (can be parallel)
  - US3-US7, US9 are P2 priority - complete second (can be parallel)
  - US8, US10 are P3 priority - complete last
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundational only - no other story dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Foundational only - independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (auth code flow needed for browser tests)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (builds on auth code flow)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Foundational only - DCR independent
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Foundational + token endpoint from US1
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (error injection on existing flows)
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Foundational only - JWKS independent
- **User Story 9 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (observability for auth flows)
- **User Story 10 (P3)**: Depends on ALL other stories (CI runs everything)

### Within Each User Story

- Implementation tasks before test tasks (this feature IS tests)
- Core handlers before advanced features
- Unit tests before integration tests

### Parallel Opportunities

- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- T007, T009, T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel after T005, T006
- Within US1: T013-T017 (authorize) can run parallel to T018-T020 (token) after T016
- US1 and US2 can run in parallel (both P1, no dependencies)
- US3, US4, US5, US6, US7, US9 can all run in parallel (after US1)
- US8 can run any time after Foundational
- T098, T099, T100 can run in parallel (documentation)

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Foundational

```bash
# After T005, T006 complete, launch these in parallel:
Task: "Implement OAuthTestServer struct in tests/oauthserver/server.go"
Task: "Create login.html template in tests/oauthserver/templates/login.html"
Task: "Implement DiscoveryMetadata in tests/oauthserver/discovery.go"
Task: "Implement /.well-known/openid-configuration in tests/oauthserver/discovery.go"
Task: "Implement /jwks.json endpoint in tests/oauthserver/jwks.go"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After authorize endpoints complete (T013-T017):
Task: "Implement /token with grant_type=authorization_code in tests/oauthserver/token.go"
Task: "Implement PKCE verification in tests/oauthserver/token.go"
Task: "Implement /token with grant_type=refresh_token in tests/oauthserver/token.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Auth Code + PKCE)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `go test ./tests/oauthserver/... -run TestAuthCodePKCE`
5. This delivers immediate value - basic OAuth testing works

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → OAuth test server boots
2. Add User Story 1 → Auth code + PKCE tests work (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Detection tests work
4. Add User Story 3 → Browser tests work
5. Add User Stories 4-9 → All flows + observability
6. Add User Story 10 → CI integration complete

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Story 1 + User Story 2

This provides:
- Working OAuth test server with discovery
- Auth code + PKCE flow
- Token refresh
- Detection mode testing

Total tasks for MVP: T001-T031 (31 tasks)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- This feature IS the test infrastructure - tests are primary deliverables
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
