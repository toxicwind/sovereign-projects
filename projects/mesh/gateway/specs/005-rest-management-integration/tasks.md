# Tasks: REST Endpoint Management Service Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-rest-management-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/management-service.yaml

**Tests**: Test tasks included per FR-015, FR-016, FR-017 (unit, integration, E2E validation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This project uses single project structure:
- `internal/` - All Go packages
- `cmd/` - Command-line applications
- `scripts/` - Test and build scripts

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify existing infrastructure and review current implementations

Since this is a refactoring within an existing codebase, setup is minimal.

- [x] T001 Review existing management service interface in internal/management/service.go
- [x] T002 Review existing runtime implementations in internal/server/server.go:1447 and internal/server/server.go:136
- [x] T003 [P] Review existing REST handlers in internal/httpapi/server.go:1155 and internal/httpapi/server.go:1050

**Checkpoint**: Understand current code structure before refactoring

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core interface extension that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No REST handler work can begin until management service interface is extended

- [x] T004 Extend ManagementService interface in internal/management/service.go with GetServerTools method signature
- [x] T005 Extend ManagementService interface in internal/management/service.go with TriggerOAuthLogin method signature

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Unified Server Management via REST API (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Refactor two REST endpoints to delegate to management service layer, ensuring architectural compliance with spec 004 and consistent behavior across all interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Call REST endpoints directly (`GET /api/v1/servers/{id}/tools` and `POST /api/v1/servers/{id}/login`) and verify they delegate to management service methods, emit events, and respect configuration gates.

### Unit Tests for User Story 1 (Per FR-015)

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST using TDD approach, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Add unit test for GetServerTools with valid server name in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Add unit test for GetServerTools with empty server name in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Add unit test for GetServerTools with nonexistent server in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Add unit test for TriggerOAuthLogin with valid server in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Add unit test for TriggerOAuthLogin with disable_management enabled in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Add unit test for TriggerOAuthLogin with read_only enabled in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Add unit test for TriggerOAuthLogin with empty server name in internal/management/service_test.go

### Implementation for User Story 1

**Service Layer Implementation:**

- [x] T013 [US1] Implement GetServerTools method in internal/management/service_impl.go - delegate to runtime.GetServerTools
- [x] T014 [US1] Implement TriggerOAuthLogin method in internal/management/service_impl.go - check config gates, delegate to runtime.TriggerOAuthLogin
- [x] T015 [US1] Add configuration gate checks in TriggerOAuthLogin (disable_management, read_only) in internal/management/service_impl.go

**REST Handler Refactoring:**

- [x] T016 [US1] Update handleGetServerTools in internal/httpapi/server.go:1155 to call management service instead of controller
- [x] T017 [US1] Update handleServerLogin in internal/httpapi/server.go:1050 to call management service instead of controller
- [x] T018 [US1] Add error mapping for management service errors to HTTP status codes in handleGetServerTools
- [x] T019 [US1] Add error mapping for management service errors to HTTP status codes in handleServerLogin

**Mock Updates:**

- [x] T020 [US1] Update MockServerController in internal/httpapi/contracts_test.go to include GetServerTools method
- [x] T021 [US1] Update MockServerController in internal/httpapi/contracts_test.go to include TriggerOAuthLogin method

**Integration Testing (Per FR-016):**

- [x] T022 [US1] Add integration test to verify servers.changed event emitted after OAuth completion in internal/management/service_test.go
- [x] T023 [US1] Verify event propagates to SSE endpoint /events (monitor event bus integration)

**E2E Validation (Per FR-017, SC-005):**

- [x] T024 [US1] Run existing E2E API tests with ./scripts/test-api-e2e.sh and verify all pass without modification
- [x] T025 [US1] Verify no behavioral changes in REST API responses (backward compatibility check)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - REST endpoints delegate to management service, config gates enforced, events emitted, E2E tests pass

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - CLI Socket Commands Use Management Layer (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure CLI commands from PR #152 (`tools list`, `auth login`, `auth status`) benefit from management service's configuration gates, event emissions, and error handling.

**Independent Test**: Run `mcpproxy tools list --server=test-server` and `mcpproxy auth login --server=test-server` with daemon running, verify they work correctly and trigger management service events.

**Note**: No new implementation required for this story - it automatically benefits once REST endpoints are refactored in US1. This phase is purely validation.

### Validation for User Story 2

- [x] T026 [US2] Start mcpproxy daemon and verify it's running
- [x] T027 [US2] Test mcpproxy tools list --server=<name> command and verify tools retrieved via management service
- [x] T028 [US2] Test mcpproxy auth login --server=<name> command and verify OAuth triggered via management service
- [x] T029 [US2] Test mcpproxy auth status --server=<name> command and verify authentication state shown
- [x] T030 [US2] Enable disable_management in config and verify mcpproxy auth login is blocked with clear error
- [x] T031 [US2] Verify servers.changed event emitted after OAuth completion (monitor logs or SSE stream)

**Checkpoint**: CLI commands work correctly through refactored REST endpoints, config gates enforced, events emitted

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Tray Application Server Management (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure tray application users get consistent behavior when managing servers through GUI menus (passive benefit from US1 refactoring).

**Independent Test**: Use tray menu actions to trigger OAuth login and verify operations go through management service with proper event emissions.

**Note**: No new implementation required - tray already uses REST API endpoints refactored in US1. This phase is purely validation.

### Validation for User Story 3

- [x] T032 [US3] Launch mcpproxy-tray application and verify connection to daemon
- [x] T033 [US3] Use tray menu "Authenticate Server" action and verify OAuth triggered via management service
- [x] T034 [US3] Verify tray UI updates automatically after OAuth completion (SSE event received)
- [x] T035 [US3] Enable read_only mode and verify server restart blocked via tray menu with error message
- [x] T036 [US3] Verify all tray server management actions use refactored REST endpoints

**Checkpoint**: Tray application works correctly through refactored REST endpoints, automatic UI updates via events

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final cleanup, documentation updates, and comprehensive validation

### Documentation

- [x] T037 Add code comments explaining delegation pattern in internal/management/service_impl.go
- [x] T038 Update CLAUDE.md if management service patterns changed (minimal changes expected)
- [x] T039 Update OpenAPI annotations in internal/httpapi/server.go if endpoint behavior changed

### Code Quality

- [x] T040 Run golangci-lint on modified files: ./scripts/run-linter.sh
- [x] T041 Verify test coverage ≥80% for new management service methods: go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/management/...
- [x] T042 [P] Check for code duplication removed (SC-006): compare LOC before/after refactoring

### Final Validation

- [x] T043 Run full test suite: ./scripts/run-all-tests.sh
- [x] T044 Manual smoke test: Start daemon, call all refactored endpoints, verify responses
- [x] T045 Performance verification: Ensure no regression in API response times (<10ms for GetServerTools, <50ms for TriggerOAuthLogin)

**Final Checkpoint**: All success criteria met, ready for PR submission
