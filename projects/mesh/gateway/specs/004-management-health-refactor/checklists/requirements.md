# Specification Quality Checklist: Management Service Refactoring & OpenAPI Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation.

### Key Strengths:
1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, avoiding HOW
2. **Comprehensive user stories**: Four prioritized stories covering all major workflows
3. **Well-defined success criteria**: All metrics are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "operators can execute operations via CLI/REST/MCP" rather than "Go service implements interface")
4. **Detailed functional requirements**: 30 requirements organized by category with clear MUST statements
5. **Edge cases identified**: Six edge cases with expected behaviors documented
6. **No clarifications needed**: All requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions

### Assumptions Made:
- OpenAPI spec location: `oas/swagger.yaml` (industry standard practice)
- Build integration: Makefile-based generation (consistent with existing `make build` command)
- Log tail limits: default 50, max 1000 (standard pagination practices)
- Diagnostics timeout: 3 seconds for 20 servers (reasonable for local operations)
- Code coverage target: 80% (standard for critical service layers)

### Next Steps:
Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate the implementation plan.
