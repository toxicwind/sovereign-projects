> Related: issue #955 ("request queueing / concurrency limit for multi-user deployments"). Decision analysis with choke-point audit and option comparison: `docs/research/request-concurrency-issue-955-2026-08-07.html` (Option A chosen).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Cap concurrent load on a fragile upstream (Priority: P1)

An operator runs mcpproxy as a shared service for multiple users/agents. One upstream MCP server is backed by a database that falls over under concurrent load. The operator sets a per-server concurrency limit; bursts of simultaneous tool calls to that server now run at most N at a time, with excess requests waiting briefly in a bounded queue instead of hammering the upstream — regardless of which user, agent, or internal feature (including sandboxed code execution) originated them.

**Why this priority**: This is the core ask of #955 — protecting stateful upstreams from multi-user bursts without external infrastructure. Everything else refines it.

**Independent Test**: Configure `max_concurrent_requests: 1, queue_size: 1` on a slow test upstream; fire 3 concurrent tool calls; observe exactly one running, one queued (then running), one rejected — and the upstream never sees 2 simultaneous requests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server with `max_concurrent_requests: 2`, **When** 5 tool calls arrive simultaneously for it, **Then** at most 2 execute against the upstream at any moment and the rest wait their turn in arrival order.
2. **Given** the same limit, **When** calls originate from different surfaces (MCP tool-call variants, legacy call, REST tool-call endpoint, sandboxed code-execution scripts, activity replay), **Then** all of them count against and are bounded by the same per-server limit — no origin bypasses it.
3. **Given** a stdio-based upstream with a limit, **When** concurrent calls arrive, **Then** the limit applies the same way it does for HTTP upstreams.
4. **Given** no limits are configured (defaults), **When** any burst arrives, **Then** behavior is exactly as today — unlimited, no queueing, no new failure modes.

---

### User Story 2 - Bounded queue with predictable shedding (Priority: P2)

When a limited server is saturated, excess requests wait in a bounded queue. If the queue is full, new requests are rejected immediately; if a queued request waits longer than the configured queue timeout, it is rejected then. In both cases the caller gets a clear, machine-actionable "server busy — retry" signal rather than a hang, a cryptic failure, or an aborted agent session.

**Why this priority**: Queueing without bounds trades overload for unbounded latency and memory; shedding without clear semantics breaks agent loops. This story makes saturation safe and observable for callers.

**Independent Test**: With `max_concurrent_requests: 1, queue_size: 1, queue_timeout: 2s` and a deliberately slow upstream, verify: 2nd call queues then runs; 3rd call is rejected instantly with a busy message; a queued call that waits > 2s is rejected with a timeout-flavored busy message; the AI agent making the calls sees a readable error it can retry, not a dropped connection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the queue is full, **When** another call for that server arrives, **Then** it is rejected immediately (no waiting) with a message naming the server, its limit, and advising retry.
2. **Given** a call is queued, **When** it waits longer than `queue_timeout`, **Then** it is rejected with a busy/timeout message; **When** the caller cancels while queued, **Then** the slot is released and the cancellation is reported as such (not as "server busy").
3. **Given** an MCP agent client made the call, **When** it is shed, **Then** the rejection arrives as a normal tool-call error result (the kind agents read and retry), not a protocol/transport failure that can abort the session.
4. **Given** the call came via the REST API, **When** it is shed, **Then** the response is HTTP 429 with a Retry-After hint.
5. **Given** requests are being shed, **When** the operator inspects the activity log, **Then** shed calls are recorded with a distinct "rejected" status (distinguishable from upstream errors) including which limit triggered (queue full vs. queue timeout).

---

### User Story 3 - Global backstop and live tuning (Priority: P3)

The operator also sets a global concurrency cap as a backstop for the whole proxy, and tunes any of the limits at runtime by editing the config file — changes apply to a running instance without a restart and without disrupting in-flight calls. Saturation is visible in metrics so the operator can right-size limits.

**Why this priority**: Multi-user operators need a whole-instance guardrail and zero-downtime tuning; observability closes the loop. Valuable, but only after per-server limiting works.

**Independent Test**: Set a global limit lower than the sum of per-server limits, verify aggregate concurrency never exceeds it; change limits in the config file while under load and verify the new values take effect without restart or dropped in-flight calls; confirm rejection counters and queue metrics move.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a global `max_concurrent_requests`, **When** load spans many servers, **Then** total concurrent upstream tool calls never exceed the global cap, and a slow server's queue does not consume global capacity while waiting.
2. **Given** a running instance under load, **When** the operator changes limit values in the config file, **Then** new values govern all subsequent admissions without restart; running calls are never interrupted (they count against the new caps until they finish), and queued calls keep their original wait deadline but are admitted only under the new caps.
3. **Given** limits are active, **When** the operator scrapes metrics, **Then** rejection counts (by server and reason) and queue depth are available; sustained saturation is visible.
4. **Given** the server edition with multiple users, **When** several users call the same upstream, **Then** per-server limits bound the users' combined load on that upstream.

---

### Edge Cases

- Caller cancels/disconnects while queued → the queue slot frees immediately; no leaked capacity.
- Queue wait must not silently consume the existing per-call execution timeout — a call that queues 20s still gets its full execution time budget.
- Limits change while requests are queued → existing waiters keep their original absolute deadlines but are admitted under the new caps (per FR-021's shared occupancy accounting); new arrivals see new rules; no double-counting or lost slots during the swap.
- A server is disabled/quarantined/removed while calls are queued for it → queued calls fail with the existing server-unavailable semantics, not a hang until queue timeout.
- Per-server limit larger than global → global still wins; documentation states effective concurrency is min of the two.
- Per-server tri-state: absent inherits the per-server default set (not the global limiter); explicit 0 opts a server out of that setting while the global aggregate cap still applies; nonsensical configs (negative values, queue attached to a disabled limit) are rejected at validation with clear messages.
- A queued call must never stall unrelated server management: admission happens outside any shared manager lock, and disabling/removing a server promptly fails its queued calls.
- Internal traffic that is not upstream tool calls (local tool search, cached tool listings, lightweight health probes) is not throttled and cannot deadlock behind the limiter.
- The standalone CLI debug client (separate process) is out of scope and documented as such.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Limiting & queueing**

- **FR-001**: Operators MUST be able to set a per-server maximum on concurrently executing upstream tool calls; excess calls wait in a bounded FIFO queue of configurable size (`max_concurrent_requests`, `queue_size` per server).
- **FR-002**: Operators MUST be able to set a global maximum on concurrently executing upstream tool calls across all servers, layered with per-server limits such that waiting for a specific server's slot does not consume global capacity.
- **FR-003**: Every in-process origin of upstream tool calls MUST be subject to the limits — the MCP tool-call variants, the legacy tool-call path, direct-routing mode, the REST tool-call endpoint, sandboxed code-execution scripts, and activity replay. No origin may bypass the limiter.
- **FR-004**: A call arriving when the queue is full MUST be rejected immediately. A queued call MUST be rejected when its total wait exceeds the configured `queue_timeout` — a single absolute deadline spanning both the per-server and global admission steps combined (never `queue_timeout` per step). Queue order MUST be first-in-first-out.
- **FR-005**: The call's execution timeout MUST begin only after admission (all limiter tiers acquired) so queue waiting never consumes execution budget; this applies to every origin, including internal ones whose execution deadline is currently created before the upstream call (activity replay MUST be adjusted accordingly). A caller's own deadline/cancellation is still honored while queued: cancellation MUST release the slot immediately and be reported as cancellation, not as shedding.
- **FR-006**: With no limits configured (the default), observable behavior MUST be unchanged: no queueing, no limiting, no new errors, and performance overhead within the agreed regression threshold (see SC-002).
- **FR-007**: Lightweight non-tool-call traffic (local tool search, coalesced tool listings, health probes) MUST NOT be throttled by these limits.
- **FR-008**: A call MUST NOT wait in a limiter queue while holding any proxy-wide or manager-wide lock: the dispatch layer MUST resolve the target client and release shared locks before admission begins, so queued calls never block server add/remove/disable, reconciliation, or config reload.
- **FR-009**: When a server is disabled, removed, or quarantined, its queued calls MUST be failed promptly with the existing server-unavailable semantics (not left to hit `queue_timeout`). Admission MUST atomically re-check the server's lifecycle state (a lifecycle token/tombstone honored by the limiter), so a call that snapshotted its client before the state change cannot enqueue after the change — no admit-after-disable race. A retired limiter instance MUST be drained (all outstanding holds released) before its capacity is considered gone; if a server with the same name is re-added while old holds are still draining, the new instance's capacity MUST NOT be double-counted against the drained one (fresh limiter, old holds release into the retired instance only).

**Shed semantics**

- **FR-010**: A shed MCP tool call MUST return a normal tool-call error result (readable by agent LLMs, retry-friendly) that states which limit triggered — the named server's limit or the proxy-wide (global) limit — and advises retrying shortly; never a transport/protocol failure that can abort an agent session. The message MUST NOT blame a server when the global limiter was the trigger.
- **FR-011**: A shed REST tool call MUST return HTTP 429 with a Retry-After hint. The limiter's typed rejection identity MUST be preserved end-to-end through the REST dispatch path (today intermediate layers flatten errors into strings, which would make 429 mapping impossible); Retry-After derives from the effective `queue_timeout` of the scope that shed the call. Queues are always bounded (there is no unbounded-queue mode; `queue_size: 0` means no pending capacity).
- **FR-012**: Every shed call MUST be recorded with a dedicated "rejected" activity status regardless of origin — including origins that bypass the MCP dispatch layer (sandboxed code execution, activity replay) — via an origin-independent rejection seam at or below the limiter, carrying stable metadata: `reason` (queue_full | queue_timeout) and `scope` (server | global) plus the server name and origin. Because activity status is a closed vocabulary today, the new status MUST be propagated through the full consumer contract: storage/API schema, activity filters and summaries, usage aggregation, exports, and Web UI rendering.
- **FR-013**: Rejection counters (per server, per reason, per scope) and queue depth MUST be exposed through the existing metrics surface, again independent of call origin.

**Configuration & operations**

- **FR-020**: The config surface MUST define three distinct, separately named scopes, each carrying all three settings (`max_concurrent_requests`, `queue_size`, `queue_timeout`) with uniform semantics:
  (a) the **global aggregate limiter** — one proxy-wide limiter with its own three values; `max_concurrent_requests: 0` (the default) disables it;
  (b) an optional **per-server default set** — blanket values inherited by every server that does not override them; absent = no per-server limiting by default;
  (c) **per-server overrides** — tri-state for each setting independently: absent = inherit the default set; explicit 0 = disable that setting for this server (0 for the limit = no per-server limiter; 0 for queue_size = no pending capacity, shed immediately at the cap); positive = override.
  The global aggregate limiter is never a per-server inheritance source. Documentation MUST state that a server's effective concurrency is bounded by both its resolved per-server limit and the global limiter.
- **FR-021**: All limit settings MUST be hot-reloadable without restart, published as one atomic generation (calls never observe a mix of new and old values across scopes). **Occupancy accounting is shared across generations**: running calls are never interrupted but continue to count against the new caps — after lowering a cap, no new admissions occur until occupancy drains below it (transient over-cap from grandfathered running calls is permitted and ends when they complete); already-queued calls keep their original absolute queue deadline but are admitted only under the new caps. Raising a cap admits eligible queued calls immediately. This is what "takes effect within one reload cycle" (SC-004) means.
- **FR-022**: The global aggregate limiter's settings MUST be overridable via environment variables following the existing naming convention, documented, and reflected in the API schema like any other config field. The per-server default set and per-server overrides are file/API-configured only (no per-server env scheme exists or is introduced).
- **FR-023**: Validation MUST reject, per scope after resolution: negative values, and a positive queue size whose corresponding concurrency limit resolves to disabled/unlimited — with actionable error messages naming the offending scope (global, defaults, or server name) and field.
- **FR-024**: Limits MUST apply identically in the personal and server editions; in the server edition, per-server limits bound the combined load of all users on that upstream.

### Key Entities

- **Limit scope**: one of three separately configured scopes — global aggregate limiter, per-server default set, per-server override — each carrying max_concurrent_requests / queue_size / queue_timeout; per-server values are tri-state per setting (absent = inherit defaults, 0 = disabled, positive = value); global 0 = no global limiter.
- **Wait queue**: bounded FIFO of admitted-but-not-yet-running calls for a given limit; characterized by size and per-call wait deadline.
- **Shed event**: a rejected call — reason (queue_full | queue_timeout), scope (server | global), origin surface, server, timestamp; appears in the activity log and metrics regardless of origin.
- **Limit generation**: the atomically published snapshot of all limit values (all three scopes) governing admissions; hot reload replaces the generation as a unit while occupancy accounting is shared across generations.
- **Effective limit resolution**: per-server explicit value (0 = disabled, positive = cap) → absent inherits the per-server default set → no per-server limiting; effective concurrency for a server is additionally bounded by the global aggregate limiter.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: With a per-server limit of N configured, the upstream never observes more than N simultaneous requests, under bursts of at least 10× N, from any mix of origins — verified for both stdio and HTTP upstreams.
- **SC-002**: With defaults (no limits), the existing regression suites (unit, race, API E2E) pass unchanged, and tool-call latency overhead versus the previous release stays within an agreed threshold (≤1% median in the standard benchmark) — measured, not asserted.
- **SC-003**: Under sustained 5× overload of a limited server, agent clients continue operating: 100% of shed calls surface as readable retryable errors; zero client sessions abort due to shedding.
- **SC-004**: An operator can raise or lower any limit on a loaded instance and see it take effect within one config-reload cycle, with zero dropped in-flight calls.
- **SC-005**: Every shed call is attributable in the activity log (status, reason, server) and counted in metrics; queue-full sheds respond in under 100 ms (no waiting on a full queue).
- **SC-006**: The #955 deployment pattern (multi-user headless service in front of a database-backed stdio server) can cap that server's concurrency without any external reverse proxy, including traffic that never traverses an external listener.

## Assumptions

- The chosen approach is Option A from the decision report: a two-tier (admission + run) limiter at the single managed-client choke point, per-server acquired before global. The report's choke-point audit — including the finding that code-execution and replay paths bypass the manager layer — is the authoritative placement rationale.
- Cross-model review (Codex, round 1) established two placement corrections the plan must honor: (1) the manager dispatch path currently holds a manager-wide read lock across the upstream call, so dispatch must snapshot the client and release shared locks before admission (FR-008); (2) activity replay currently creates its execution-timeout context before calling the client, so it must be restructured for FR-005 to hold.
- Defaults ship as unlimited (0/0, 30s queue timeout when queueing is enabled): zero behavior change on upgrade. Documentation will recommend a small limit (e.g. 5) for stdio upstreams, mirroring common SDK worker-pool sizes; stdio does not require limit=1 since the transport legitimately multiplexes.
- Per-user fairness within a server's queue (server edition) is out of scope for v1; the design keys limiters by server name so a future per-(user,server) extension (Spec 074 direction) does not require rework.
- Upstream tool listings and health probes stay outside the limits (already coalesced / lightweight); a strict "count everything" mode is not offered in v1.
- Shedding uses tool-result errors for MCP and 429 for REST; an additional JSON-RPC protocol-error convention (e.g. -32029) is deferred until client behavior is verified.
- The separate-process CLI debug client is documented as out of scope.
