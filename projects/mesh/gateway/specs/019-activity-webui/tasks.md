# Tasks: Activity Log Web UI

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/019-activity-webui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Unit tests with Vitest and E2E verification with Playwriter as specified in the feature requirements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/` for Vue 3 components and services
- **Tests**: `frontend/tests/unit/` for Vitest tests
- **Docs**: `docs/docs/` for Docusaurus documentation

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Add foundational types and API methods needed by all user stories

- [x] T001 Add Activity TypeScript types to `frontend/src/types/api.ts`
- [x] T002 [P] Add `getActivities()` API method to `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (View Page) and US2 (Real-time) can proceed in parallel
  - US3 (Filters), US4 (Details), US5 (Widget) can start after US1 completes
  - US6 (Export), US7 (Pagination), US8 (Toggle) can start after US1 completes
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Dependencies | Can Start After |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| US1 - View Activity Log Page | P1 | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |
| US2 - Real-time Updates | P1 | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |
| US3 - Filter Activity | P2 | US1 | US1 complete |
| US4 - View Details | P2 | US1 | US1 complete |
| US5 - Dashboard Widget | P2 | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |
| US6 - Export Records | P3 | US1, US3 | US3 complete |
| US7 - Pagination | P3 | US1 | US1 complete |
| US8 - Auto-refresh Toggle | P3 | US2 | US2 complete |

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- UI components before event handlers
- State management before API connections
- Story complete before Playwriter verification

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks T002-T005 can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks T007-T008 can run in parallel
- US1 and US2 can proceed in parallel after Foundational
- US5 (Dashboard Widget) is independent and can run in parallel with US1-US4
- All Polish phase tests (T064-T068) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# Launch all API method additions together:
Task: "Add `getActivities()` API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts"
Task: "Add `getActivityDetail()` API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts"
Task: "Add `getActivitySummary()` API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts"
Task: "Add `getActivityExportUrl()` API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 Filters

```bash
# Launch parallel filter dropdowns together:
Task: "Implement server filter dropdown in frontend/src/views/Activity.vue"
Task: "Implement status filter dropdown in frontend/src/views/Activity.vue"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (types and API methods)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (route, nav, skeleton)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (basic table view)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (real-time updates)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 and US2 with Playwriter
6. Deploy/demo if ready - users can view activity log with live updates

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (View Page) → Test → Deploy (basic viewing)
3. Add US2 (Real-time) → Test → Deploy (live updates)
4. Add US3 (Filters) + US4 (Details) → Test → Deploy (full browsing)
5. Add US5 (Widget) → Test → Deploy (dashboard integration)
6. Add US6-US8 (Export, Pagination, Toggle) → Test → Deploy (complete feature)
7. Complete Polish → Final release

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = User Story 1 + User Story 2**

This delivers:
- Activity Log page accessible from navigation
- Table with all columns (Time, Type, Server, Details, Status, Duration)
- Real-time updates via SSE
- Basic empty/error states

Users can immediately start monitoring AI agent activity in real-time.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Use Playwriter (`mcp__playwriter__execute`) for E2E verification after each story
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow existing Vue 3 + DaisyUI patterns from ToolCalls.vue and Dashboard.vue
