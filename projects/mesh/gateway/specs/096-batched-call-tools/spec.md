# Feature Specification: Batched call_tools() for Parallel Upstream Calls in the Code-Execution Sandbox

**Feature Branch**: `096-batched-call-tools`
**Created**: 2026-08-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Batched call_tools() host primitive so independent upstream calls run in parallel inside the code-execution JS sandbox (GitHub issue #987)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fan-out orchestration completes in parallel time (Priority: P1)

An AI agent uses the code-execution sandbox to orchestrate many independent upstream tool calls in one request — fetch 20 pull requests, read 15 issues, poll 8 servers. Today each `call_tool()` is strictly serial, so the run costs the *sum* of the upstream latencies (a measured run made 31 upstream calls in 20.6 seconds, nearly all of it waiting on I/O with no ordering dependency). With `call_tools()`, the script hands the whole independent set to the host in one call and receives all results at once, so the run costs roughly the *slowest* call, not the sum.

**Why this priority**: Fan-out is the headline use case the code-execution feature exists for, and it is the pattern that pays the most under serial execution. Without this story there is no feature.

**Independent Test**: Run a script that issues N independent calls against a stub upstream with a fixed per-call delay, once as a `call_tool()` loop and once as one `call_tools()` batch; the batched run completes in a fraction of the serial time and returns identical per-call results in input order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a connected upstream server whose tool responds in ~300ms, **When** a script calls `call_tools()` with 10 independent requests to it, **Then** all 10 results arrive in input order, each carrying the same envelope a lone `call_tool()` would return, and the batch completes in significantly less time than 10 serial calls.
2. **Given** a batch whose elements target several different servers, **When** the batch runs, **Then** every element executes with the same scope enforcement and logging treatment it would receive as an individual `call_tool()`.
3. **Given** an empty array, **When** `call_tools([])` is called, **Then** it returns an empty array immediately and consumes none of the execution's tool-call budget.

### User Story 2 - One failure never poisons the batch (Priority: P2)

A script fans out 20 calls; one target server is down and one element references a tool that does not exist. The batch still returns 20 slots in input order: 18 carry `{ok: true, result}`, the 2 failures carry `{ok: false, error}` with the same error codes a lone `call_tool()` would produce. The script inspects each slot and proceeds with the successes.

**Why this priority**: Per-slot error isolation is the reason to prefer an explicit batch API over implicit parallelism; without it a single flaky upstream destroys whole-batch results and the primitive is unusable for real fan-out.

**Independent Test**: Build a batch mixing valid elements, an unknown server, an unknown tool, and a scope-violating element; assert every slot resolves, failures carry per-slot errors, and successes are unaffected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a batch of 5 where element 3 targets a server that is not connected, **When** the batch runs, **Then** slots 1, 2, 4, 5 carry results, slot 3 carries `{ok: false, error}`, and no slot is missing or reordered.
2. **Given** a batch element that violates the execution's server scope (caller allow-list, profile scope, or agent-token scope), **When** the batch runs, **Then** that slot fails with the same error code and attribution a lone `call_tool()` to that server produces today, and sibling slots are unaffected.

---

### User Story 3 - Concurrency stays operator-controlled (Priority: P3)

An operator caps how hard one sandbox execution may hammer upstreams. The batch runs at most `max_parallel` elements at once — from configuration by default, overridable per call within a fixed permitted range — and always honors the per-server concurrency and queueing limits that already govern individual calls (Spec 093). A batch can never become a way around those limits.

**Why this priority**: Without a bound, one script could open unbounded concurrent upstream requests; without respecting per-server limits, the batch would bypass protections that individual calls obey. Both would make the feature unshippable, but the default bound makes this safe out of the box, so it ranks after the core semantics.

**Independent Test**: Point a batch of 10 at a stub server that records concurrent-request high-water mark; with `max_parallel` 3 the high-water mark never exceeds 3; with a per-server concurrency limit of 1 configured, requests to that server serialize regardless of `max_parallel`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the configured default `max_parallel`, **When** a batch larger than the bound runs, **Then** no more than `max_parallel` elements are in flight at any moment and all elements still complete.
2. **Given** a per-call `max_parallel` override within the permitted range, **When** the batch runs, **Then** the override governs; an override outside the permitted range (or non-integer) is rejected before any element is dispatched.
3. **Given** a per-server concurrency limit lower than `max_parallel`, **When** a batch targets that server, **Then** the per-server limit governs those elements exactly as it governs individual calls: they queue when the server has queue capacity configured, and are shed with that server's standard per-call error when it does not — never bypassed.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Budget exhaustion**: pre-dispatch checks (shape validation, scope enforcement, budget) are evaluated deterministically in input order before any element is dispatched, so concurrency can never oversubscribe the budget. Elements beyond the remaining `max_tool_calls` budget resolve per-slot with the same over-budget error a lone `call_tool()` produces, and are never dispatched.
- **Execution timeout during the batch**: the execution fails as a whole with the same timeout outcome as a lone in-flight `call_tool()` today; the script never resumes, so no partial batch value is observable. All queued elements are abandoned and in-flight work is cancelled (see FR-007).
- **Malformed call**: a non-array argument; an element that is not an object with non-empty `server` and `tool` strings; a supplied `args` that is not an object; a sparse array hole; or a non-object/invalid `options` — any of these cause `call_tools()` to return a single `{ok: false, error}` envelope (the same shape a lone `call_tool()` uses for invalid arguments) identifying the first offending element index, with nothing dispatched and no budget consumed. Unknown `options` fields are ignored.
- **Single-element batch**: behaves identically to `call_tool()` for that element, envelope included.
- **Duplicate elements**: permitted; each executes and is budgeted independently.
- **Non-JSON-serializable result**: an element whose upstream result cannot be represented in the documented wire shape fails that slot with the same serialization error a lone `call_tool()` produces; siblings are unaffected.
- **Oversized batch**: batches longer than the fixed batch-size cap (FR-013) are rejected as malformed before any dispatch.
- **Sandbox character preserved**: the sandbox remains timer-free with no promises or event loop; `call_tools()` is synchronous from the script's point of view (it returns the completed results array). The supported JavaScript language level is unchanged by this feature.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The code-execution sandbox MUST expose a `call_tools(requests, options?)` function accepting an array of `{server, tool, args?}` elements (`args` defaults to an empty object) and returning an array of the same length, in input order, one slot per element.
- **FR-002**: Each result slot MUST carry exactly the envelope `call_tool()` returns — `{ok: true, result}` or `{ok: false, error: {code, message}}` — and a failing element MUST NOT affect any other slot (no short-circuiting).
- **FR-003**: Independent elements MUST execute concurrently such that a batch of N independent calls completes in wall-clock time bounded by the slowest element plus scheduling overhead, not the sum of element latencies, whenever N is within the concurrency bound.
- **FR-004**: Concurrency MUST be bounded by `max_parallel`, defined as: a new configuration field `code_execution_max_parallel` (integer; default 8 when absent or 0; permitted range 1–32; identical in both editions; a changed value applies to executions that start after the change), overridable per call via `options.max_parallel` (integer; same 1–32 range; fractional, non-numeric, or out-of-range values reject the whole call as malformed before any dispatch).
- **FR-005**: Batched elements MUST respect the same per-server concurrency and queueing limits that govern individual upstream calls (Spec 093); the batch MUST NOT provide any path around them.
- **FR-006**: Each dispatched element MUST count against the execution's `max_tool_calls` budget individually, with budget evaluated deterministically in input order during pre-dispatch checks (before any element is dispatched). Elements beyond the remaining budget MUST resolve per-slot with the same over-budget error as a lone `call_tool()`, without being dispatched. Elements rejected pre-dispatch (scope, shape, budget) MUST NOT consume budget — matching what a lone `call_tool()` consumes today for the same failure.
- **FR-007**: The batch MUST be bounded by the overall execution timeout with no additional deadline of its own. Batch workers MUST run under the execution's lifetime: at the execution deadline, queued elements are not dispatched and in-flight upstream calls are cancelled. Workers MUST never mutate script-visible execution state; completion of an already-in-flight element's internal record after the execution has returned is permitted only through internally-synchronized paths and is excluded from that execution's reported results — exactly the behavior a lone `call_tool()` in flight at timeout exhibits today.
- **FR-008**: Each slot's `result` MUST be presented in the same documented wire (JSON) shape as `call_tool()` results — never as live host values.
- **FR-009**: Every element MUST pass exactly the scope and permission enforcement an individual `call_tool()` performs today — caller allow-list / profile-scope restriction and permission-tier checks, with identical error codes and attribution — evaluated per element. This feature neither adds nor removes enforcement relative to `call_tool()`; any change to the sandbox's gate coverage (e.g., per-tool approval or quarantine checks) is explicitly out of scope and would apply to both primitives in a separate feature.
- **FR-010**: Every dispatched element MUST be recorded in tool-call history and activity logging exactly as an individual `call_tool()` would be, correlated to the same parent execution. Elements that fail pre-dispatch MUST produce exactly the records a lone `call_tool()` failing the same check produces today — no more, no fewer.
- **FR-011**: The sandbox MUST remain timer-free with no promises or event loop; `call_tools()` MUST be synchronous from the script's perspective; the supported JavaScript language level MUST be unchanged.
- **FR-012**: A malformed call (per the malformed-call edge case) MUST return a single `{ok: false, error}` envelope identifying the first offending element, with nothing dispatched and no budget consumed — never a thrown host exception.
- **FR-013**: Batch length MUST be capped at 100 elements; longer batches are malformed calls per FR-012.
- **FR-014**: `call_tools([])` MUST return an empty array, consume no tool-call budget, and dispatch nothing.
- **FR-015**: The capability MUST be available wherever `call_tool()` is available today (every surface that executes sandbox code, in both editions), and the code-execution tool description MUST document `call_tools()` alongside `call_tool()`.

### Key Entities

- **Batch request element**: one intended upstream call — target server name, tool name, and optional arguments object.
- **Batch result slot**: the outcome for one element — success envelope with the wire-shaped result, or failure envelope with an error code and message; position matches the element's input position.
- **Concurrency bound (`max_parallel`)**: the maximum number of elements in flight at once — configured default `code_execution_max_parallel` (default 8, range 1–32) with a per-call override in the same range; subordinate to per-server limits.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A batch of 10 independent calls to a stub upstream with a fixed 300ms latency completes in under 35% of the time the same 10 calls take as a serial `call_tool()` loop, at the default `max_parallel`.
- **SC-002**: A 31-element fan-out against a stub upstream with 500ms fixed latency (≥15.5s serial) completes in under 4 seconds at the default `max_parallel`.
- **SC-003**: In a batch with any mix of failing elements (unreachable server, unknown tool, scope violation, over-budget) that completes within the execution deadline, 100% of slots resolve — every failure is per-slot and every sibling success is intact.
- **SC-004**: With a per-server concurrency limit configured, the observed concurrent-request high-water mark for that server never exceeds the effective limit, regardless of `max_parallel` or batch size.
- **SC-005**: Existing single-call scripts and all existing code-execution behavior are unchanged: the full existing test suite passes without modification (beyond additions).

## Assumptions

- Parity means parity with `call_tool()` **as it behaves today**: the sandbox's current scope/permission checks and its current error codes and record-keeping are the reference behavior for every per-element requirement (FR-009, FR-010, US2). Known gaps in that behavior (e.g., error attribution that does not name the active profile, per-tool approval gates not applied in the sandbox) are pre-existing product decisions this feature inherits rather than resolves.
- The batch-size cap (100) and `max_parallel` ceiling (32) are fixed product constants, not configuration, chosen to bound memory and validation cost; revisiting them is a follow-up if real workloads demand it.
- A batch element's upstream call is cancelled at the execution deadline on a best-effort basis (the cancellation signal is sent; an upstream that ignores it is the upstream's defect).
