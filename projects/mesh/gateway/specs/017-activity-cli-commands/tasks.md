# Tasks: Activity CLI Commands

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/017-activity-cli-commands/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included per spec requirements (FR-025 TDD, constitution V).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (list) and US2 (watch) can run in parallel (both P1)
  - US3 (show) can start after Foundational
  - US4 (summary) requires backend extension first (T036-T039)
  - US5 (export) can start after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Setup
    ↓
Phase 2: Foundational (BLOCKS ALL)
    ↓
    ├── Phase 3: US1 - List (P1) 🎯 MVP
    │       ↓ (parallel with US2)
    ├── Phase 4: US2 - Watch (P1)
    │       ↓
    ├── Phase 5: US3 - Show (P2)
    │       ↓
    ├── Phase 6: US4 - Summary (P3) ← requires backend extension
    │       ↓
    └── Phase 7: US5 - Export (P4)
            ↓
      Phase 8: Polish
```

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Command definition before run function
- Run function before output formatting
- Error handling after happy path

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003 (client methods) can run in parallel with T001-T002
- T005, T006, T007 (helpers) can run in parallel
- T008, T009 (client methods) can run in parallel
- All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their story
- US1 and US2 can run in parallel (both P1 priority)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests in parallel:
Task: "T010 [P] [US1] Unit test for activity list command parsing"
Task: "T011 [P] [US1] Unit test for filter validation"
Task: "T012 [P] [US1] Add activity list E2E test case"

# After tests fail (TDD), implement sequentially:
Task: "T013 [US1] Define activityListCmd cobra.Command"
Task: "T014 [US1] Implement runActivityList()"
# ... etc
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - List
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test `mcpproxy activity list` independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (List) → Test independently → MVP!
3. Add US2 (Watch) → Test independently → Real-time monitoring
4. Add US3 (Show) → Test independently → Detail inspection
5. Add US4 (Summary) → Test independently → Dashboard
6. Add US5 (Export) → Test independently → Compliance
7. Polish phase → Documentation complete

### Two-Developer Strategy

With two developers after Foundational:
- Developer A: US1 (List) → US3 (Show) → US5 (Export)
- Developer B: US2 (Watch) → US4 (Summary) → Polish

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- US4 (Summary) requires backend extension - coordinate with spec 016
