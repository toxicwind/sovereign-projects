# Feature Specification: Agent-Discoverable Disabled Tools

**Feature Branch**: `049-agent-discoverable-disabled-tools`
**Created**: 2026-05-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Follow-up to PR #468. Brainstormed design of record: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-agent-discoverable-disabled-tools-design.md`

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent learns a needed capability exists but is locked (Priority: P1)

An AI agent is working a task that requires a capability (e.g. deleting a
repository). The matching tool exists on an upstream server but is currently
locked. Today the agent receives nothing — the tool is invisible — so it tells
the user "that's not possible" instead of "the capability exists but is turned
off." The agent should be able to, on demand, discover that the tool exists,
learn *why* it is unavailable, and relay the *correct* next step to the user or
operator.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value. Without it the other stories have
nothing to act on. Delivers a working MVP by itself: an agent can opt into
seeing locked tools and explain them.

**Independent Test**: Configure an upstream with a tool denied by config and
another disabled by the user. Issue a discovery request with the opt-in flag and
confirm both appear with distinct, correct status and remediation, while a
normal discovery request still hides them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tool denied by server config, **When** the agent runs discovery
   with the opt-in flag, **Then** the tool is returned with status
   `disabled_by_config` and remediation stating it is operator policy that the
   user cannot lift from the UI.
2. **Given** a tool disabled by the user, **When** the agent runs discovery with
   the opt-in flag, **Then** the tool is returned with status `disabled_by_user`
   and remediation telling the agent to ask the user to re-enable it.
3. **Given** the opt-in flag is absent or false, **When** the agent runs
   discovery, **Then** the response is byte-for-byte identical to today (no
   locked tools, no extra fields).
4. **Given** a mix of callable and locked tools match the query, **When** the
   agent runs discovery with the opt-in flag, **Then** callable results appear
   first in their existing order, locked results follow, and no more than
   `min(limit, 10)` locked results are returned.

---

### User Story 2 - Agent is nudged toward the opt-in path when blocked (Priority: P2)

An agent that does not know the discovery flag exists should still find it. When
a tool call is rejected because the tool is locked, or when a normal discovery
returns zero callable results while relevant locked tools exist, the agent
should be told how to get the full picture and the correct remediation.

**Why this priority**: Closes the discoverability gap of an opt-in design.
Valuable but inert without Story 1.

**Independent Test**: Call a locked tool and assert the rejection message is
status-aware and points to the opt-in discovery path; run a query whose only
matches are locked and assert the zero-result response carries a one-line count
nudge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a config-denied tool, **When** the agent calls it, **Then** the
   rejection message states it is operator policy (not user-overridable) and is
   distinct from the message for a user-disabled tool.
2. **Given** a query whose only matches are locked, **When** the agent runs
   normal discovery, **Then** the response includes a one-line note with the
   count of locked matches and how to reveal them — but not the entries
   themselves.

---

### User Story 3 - Operator/agent sees which servers hide capability (Priority: P3)

When listing or inspecting upstream servers, an agent or operator should be able
to tell, cheaply, which servers have non-callable tools and roughly why, so a
targeted discovery is warranted — without listing every locked tool name.

**Why this priority**: A corroborating signal that improves efficiency; the
feature is fully usable without it.

**Independent Test**: List servers where one has locked tools and one is fully
callable; assert the locked one carries a compact counts block and the fully
callable one carries none.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server with at least one non-callable tool, **When** servers are
   listed, **Then** that server entry includes a tool-counts block broken down
   by reason, omitting any zero-valued reason.
2. **Given** a server whose tools are all callable, **When** servers are listed,
   **Then** that server entry includes no tool-counts block at all.

### Edge Cases

- A tool is both config-denied and user-disabled → it resolves to a single
  status by fixed precedence (config wins), never double-counted.
- The reason cannot be determined (transient lookup failure) → status is
  `disabled_unknown` with a neutral remediation; the system never emits a
  *wrong* remediation (e.g. "toggle it in the UI" for a config lock).
- A fully disabled server does not re-list its tools → its tools may not appear
  in discovery at all; the authoritative signal for a fully-off server is its
  server-level state, not discovery. Documented limitation, not a defect.
- An agent has restricted server scope → locked tools on servers it cannot
  access are never revealed, even with the opt-in flag.
- A pathologically restrictive config locks hundreds of tools → the locked
  portion of any single discovery response is capped so token cost stays bounded.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Discovery MUST accept an optional opt-in parameter
  (`include_disabled`, default false) that, when true, additionally returns
  tools that exist but are not callable.
- **FR-002**: When the opt-in is absent or false, discovery output MUST be
  byte-for-byte identical to current behavior (no locked tools, no added
  fields, no reordering).
- **FR-003**: Each returned locked tool MUST carry a lean shape: name, owning
  server, the existing one-line description, and a single `status` value.
  Exception: a `server_quarantined` entry (and any tool surfaced by the
  quarantined-tool discovery pass) withholds the description and schema, so it
  carries name + owning server + `status` only.
- **FR-004**: `status` MUST be one of exactly six values —
  `disabled_by_config`, `disabled_by_user`, `pending_approval`,
  `server_disabled`, `disabled_unknown`, `server_quarantined`. The first five
  are assigned to index-discoverable tools by fixed first-match precedence in
  that order (server-off, then config, then user-disabled, then pending
  approval, else unknown). `server_quarantined` is assigned separately by the
  quarantined-tool discovery pass (not the classifier), because quarantined
  tools are deliberately absent from the search index (see Assumptions): it
  covers a tool on a quarantined server (status `server_quarantined`) and a
  tool-level pending/changed approval on a trusted server (status
  `pending_approval`), with description and schema withheld to avoid exposing a
  Tool Poisoning Attack payload. A tool also denied by operator config
  (`enabled_tools`/`disabled_tools`) is skipped by this pass rather than
  surfaced, since approval could not make it callable.
- **FR-005**: The response MUST include a single remediation map emitted once,
  containing only the keys for statuses actually present in the response; no
  per-tool remediation text.
- **FR-006**: Callable results MUST retain their existing ranking and appear
  before any locked results; locked results MUST be capped at `min(limit, 10)`
  entries.
- **FR-007**: Agent server-scope filtering MUST be applied before locked-tool
  classification, so an agent never sees locked tools on inaccessible servers.
- **FR-008**: The tool-call rejection message MUST be status-aware: a
  config-denied rejection MUST state it is operator policy and not
  user-overridable, distinct from the user-disabled/quarantine wording.
- **FR-009**: When normal discovery returns zero callable results but relevant
  locked tools exist, the response MUST include a one-line note with the count
  of locked matches and how to reveal them, without including the entries.
- **FR-010**: Server listing/inspection MUST include a per-server tool-counts
  block broken down by reason, emitted only when at least one non-callable
  count is greater than zero, with zero-valued reasons omitted.
- **FR-011**: The feature MUST NOT change enforcement — a discovered locked tool
  remains non-callable; the callability decision is unchanged.
- **FR-012**: The feature MUST NOT introduce any new persistent storage;
  classification is computed at request time from already-available state.
- **FR-013**: Opt-in usage MUST be observable via an in-memory counter only
  (never persisted), consistent with existing telemetry privacy constraints.
- **FR-014**: The opt-in parameter MUST be documented in the discovery tool's
  own description (one sentence) so an agent can use it proactively.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Locked tool entry**: A discovered tool that is not callable — name, server,
  one-line description (withheld for quarantined entries), and one `status` of
  the six-value set.
- **Status**: The single machine-branchable reason a tool is not callable,
  mapped 1:1 to a remediation class.
- **Remediation map**: Response-level mapping from each present status to one
  human/agent-actionable instruction string, emitted at most once per response.
- **Per-server tool counts**: A compact per-server rollup of tool counts by
  callability reason, conditionally attached to server list/inspect entries.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: With the opt-in off, discovery responses are identical to the
  pre-feature baseline in 100% of regression cases (byte-for-byte).
- **SC-002**: When a needed capability is locked, an agent can obtain the tool's
  existence, reason, and correct remediation within one additional request.
- **SC-003**: A config-denied lock is never communicated with user-toggle
  remediation in any surface (discovery, rejection message, server listing) —
  0 occurrences across the test matrix.
- **SC-004**: The locked portion of any single discovery response never exceeds
  10 entries regardless of how many tools are locked.
- **SC-005**: Server-listing responses for fully-callable servers gain 0 added
  bytes from this feature.
- **SC-006**: An agent that ignores the static hint still reaches the opt-in
  path via the reactive nudge in 100% of zero-callable-result cases where
  locked matches exist.

## Assumptions

- Locked tools are present in the existing search index (verified during
  brainstorming: indexing does not filter by callability; filtering is
  request-time only). Exception: quarantined tools — both on a quarantined
  server and tool-level pending/changed approvals — are deliberately excluded
  from the search index so their untrusted descriptions cannot be ranked or
  exposed (Tool Poisoning Attack defense). They are therefore not reachable via
  the index loop and are instead enumerated from authoritative quarantine state
  by a dedicated discovery pass that emits name-only `server_quarantined` /
  `pending_approval` entries.
- The config-vs-user discriminator introduced by PR #468 is available and is
  reused unchanged as the authoritative config-denial signal.
- "Limit" refers to the discovery request's existing result-limit parameter.
- The four UX fixes from the PR #468 review (status-aware rejection message,
  lock-badge color, bulk-enable feedback, copy consistency) ship in PR #468
  itself; FR-008's status-aware message is the discovery-facing extension of
  that and is owned here only insofar as it points at the opt-in path.

## Dependencies

- Builds on PR #468 (`feat/config-tool-allowlist`) being merged: requires its
  config-denial signal and the `config_denied`-aware data already plumbed.
