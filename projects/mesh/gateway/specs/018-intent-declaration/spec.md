# Feature Specification: Intent Declaration with Tool Split

**Feature Branch**: `018-intent-declaration`
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Updated**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement Phase 2 (Intent Declaration) from RFC-003 Activity Log proposal with enhanced UX: split call_tool into call_tool_read, call_tool_write, call_tool_destructive for granular IDE permission control."

## Overview

This feature introduces **intent-based tool splitting** - replacing the single `call_tool` with three operation-specific tools that enable granular permission control in IDEs like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and similar AI coding assistants.

### Key Innovation: Two-Key Security Model

Agents must declare intent in **two places** that must match:
1. **Tool selection**: `call_tool_read` / `call_tool_write` / `call_tool_destructive`
2. **Intent parameter**: `intent.operation_type` must match tool variant

```
call_tool_destructive(
  name: "github:delete_repo",
  args_json: "{}",
  intent: {
    operation_type: "destructive",  ← MUST match tool variant
    data_sensitivity: "private",
    reason: "User requested repo cleanup"
  }
)
```

**Validation chain:**
1. Tool variant declares intent → `call_tool_destructive` expects "destructive"
2. `intent.operation_type` → MUST be "destructive"
3. Mismatch → **REJECT** (agent confusion or attack attempt)
4. Server annotation check → validate against `destructiveHint`/`readOnlyHint`

This enables IDE permission settings:
```
MCPProxy Tools:
  [x] call_tool_read        → Auto-approve
  [ ] call_tool_write       → Ask each time
  [ ] call_tool_destructive → Always ask + confirm
```

### Breaking Change: Remove Legacy call_tool

The original `call_tool` is **removed entirely** (not deprecated). This is a clean break that:
- Simplifies the tool surface
- Eliminates ambiguity
- Forces explicit intent declaration
- Reduces security attack surface

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - IDE Configures Per-Tool-Type Permissions (Priority: P1)

Users configure their IDE (Cursor, Claude Desktop) to automatically approve read operations while requiring confirmation for write and destructive operations. This provides security without friction for safe operations.

**Why this priority**: This is the core UX improvement - enabling granular control that wasn't possible with a single call_tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring IDE to auto-approve call_tool_read, then verifying read operations proceed without prompts while write operations require approval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has configured "auto-approve call_tool_read" in their IDE, **When** an agent calls `call_tool_read` with matching intent, **Then** the operation proceeds without user prompt
2. **Given** a user has configured "ask for call_tool_write" in their IDE, **When** an agent calls `call_tool_write` with matching intent, **Then** the IDE prompts for user approval
3. **Given** a user has configured "always ask for call_tool_destructive", **When** an agent calls `call_tool_destructive` with matching intent, **Then** the IDE prompts for approval with clear warning

---

### User Story 2 - Agent Declares Matching Intent (Priority: P1)

AI agents must provide intent.operation_type that matches the tool variant they're calling. Mismatches are rejected to prevent confusion or malicious behavior.

**Why this priority**: Core security feature - the two-key model prevents intent spoofing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling call_tool_read with intent.operation_type="write" and verifying rejection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent calls `call_tool_read` with `intent.operation_type: "read"`, **Then** the call proceeds (matching intent)
2. **Given** an agent calls `call_tool_read` with `intent.operation_type: "write"`, **Then** the call is rejected with error "Intent mismatch: tool is call_tool_read but intent declares write"
3. **Given** an agent calls `call_tool_destructive` with `intent.operation_type: "read"`, **Then** the call is rejected with error "Intent mismatch: tool is call_tool_destructive but intent declares read"
4. **Given** an agent calls any tool variant without `intent.operation_type`, **Then** the call is rejected with error "intent.operation_type is required"

---

### User Story 3 - MCPProxy Validates Against Server Annotations (Priority: P1)

MCPProxy validates that the agent's tool choice matches server-provided annotations, rejecting mismatches where agent claims "read" but server marks tool as "destructive".

**Why this priority**: Critical security feature - prevents agents from sneaking destructive operations through auto-approved read channel.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling call_tool_read on a tool marked with destructiveHint=true and verifying rejection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tool has `destructiveHint: true` annotation, **When** agent calls `call_tool_read` with matching intent, **Then** the call is rejected with error "Tool 'X' is marked destructive by server, use call_tool_destructive"
2. **Given** a tool has `destructiveHint: true` annotation, **When** agent calls `call_tool_write` with matching intent, **Then** the call is rejected with same error
3. **Given** a tool has `readOnlyHint: true` annotation, **When** agent calls `call_tool_destructive` with matching intent, **Then** the call succeeds (overly cautious is allowed)
4. **Given** a tool has no annotations, **When** agent calls any tool variant with matching intent, **Then** the call proceeds (trust agent)

---

### User Story 4 - retrieve_tools Returns Annotations and Guidance (Priority: P1)

The retrieve_tools response includes server annotations and recommends which call_tool variant to use for each tool, enabling agents to make correct choices.

**Why this priority**: Agents need this information to select the correct tool variant.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling retrieve_tools and verifying annotations and call_with fields are present.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server provides `destructiveHint: true` for a tool, **When** agent calls `retrieve_tools`, **Then** the tool entry includes `annotations.destructiveHint: true` and `call_with: "call_tool_destructive"`
2. **Given** a server provides `readOnlyHint: true` for a tool, **When** agent calls `retrieve_tools`, **Then** the tool entry includes `annotations.readOnlyHint: true` and `call_with: "call_tool_read"`
3. **Given** a server provides no annotations, **When** agent calls `retrieve_tools`, **Then** the tool entry includes `call_with: "call_tool_write"` (safe default)
4. **Given** agent calls `retrieve_tools`, **Then** response includes `usage_instructions` explaining the three tool variants

---

### User Story 5 - CLI Tool Call Commands (Priority: P2)

Users can invoke tools via CLI with explicit intent using separate commands for each operation type.

**Why this priority**: CLI parity with MCP interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `mcpproxy call tool-read` and verifying it works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user runs `mcpproxy call tool-read --tool-name=github:list_repos --json_args='{}'`, **Then** the tool is called via call_tool_read with operation_type "read"
2. **Given** a user runs `mcpproxy call tool-write --tool-name=github:create_issue --json_args='{"title":"Bug"}'`, **Then** the tool is called via call_tool_write with operation_type "write"
3. **Given** a user runs `mcpproxy call tool-destructive --tool-name=github:delete_repo --json_args='{"repo":"test"}'`, **Then** the tool is called via call_tool_destructive with operation_type "destructive"
4. **Given** a user runs `mcpproxy call tool-read` on a destructive tool, **Then** the command fails with clear error message

---

### User Story 6 - View Intent in Activity List CLI (Priority: P2)

Users monitoring agent activity via CLI can see which tool variant was used for each operation.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into agent behavior patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `mcpproxy activity list` after tool calls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tool calls via different variants exist, **When** a user runs `mcpproxy activity list`, **Then** an Intent column shows operation type with icon (read/write/destructive)
2. **Given** tool calls exist, **When** a user runs `mcpproxy activity list -o json`, **Then** intent objects include operation_type and metadata

---

### User Story 7 - Agent Provides Additional Intent Metadata (Priority: P3)

Agents provide data sensitivity classification and reason alongside the required operation_type.

**Why this priority**: Compliance and audit requirements, secondary to core classification.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling call_tool_write with full intent and verifying storage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent provides `intent: {operation_type: "write", data_sensitivity: "private", reason: "Creating user record"}`, **Then** all fields are stored in the activity record
2. **Given** an agent omits optional fields (data_sensitivity, reason), **Then** the call succeeds with only operation_type stored

---

### User Story 8 - Filter Activity by Operation Type (Priority: P3)

Users can filter activity to see only destructive operations for security review.

**Why this priority**: Useful for auditing but not core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `mcpproxy activity list --intent-type destructive`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** various tool calls exist, **When** user runs `mcpproxy activity list --intent-type destructive`, **Then** only destructive operations are shown
2. **Given** various tool calls exist, **When** user calls `GET /api/v1/activity?intent_type=read`, **Then** only read operations are returned

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when intent.operation_type doesn't match tool variant? (REJECT - primary validation)
- What happens when agent omits intent entirely? (REJECT - intent is required)
- What happens when server has both readOnlyHint and destructiveHint? (Treat as destructive - more restrictive wins)
- What happens during retrieve_tools for tools without annotations? (Default to call_with: "call_tool_write")
- What if server changes annotations after agent discovers tools? (Re-validate at call time)
- What happens if agent calls old call_tool? (Tool not found - it's removed)

- The activity CLI commands from Spec 017 are implemented
- Legacy call_tool removal is acceptable (breaking change)

## Tool Description Updates

The following built-in tools need description updates:

### retrieve_tools
```
Current: "Search for tools across all upstream servers..."
Updated: "Search for tools across all upstream servers. Results include annotations
(readOnlyHint, destructiveHint) and recommended call_with variant. Use call_tool_read
for read-only operations, call_tool_write for modifications, call_tool_destructive
for deletions. Intent must match tool variant."
```

### call_tool_read (new)
```
"Execute a read-only tool discovered via retrieve_tools. Use for operations that
query data without modifying state. Requires intent.operation_type='read'. Will be
rejected if server marks tool as destructive."
```

### call_tool_write (new)
```
"Execute a state-modifying tool discovered via retrieve_tools. Use for operations
that create or update resources. Requires intent.operation_type='write'. Will be
rejected if server marks tool as destructive."
```

### call_tool_destructive (new)
```
"Execute a destructive tool discovered via retrieve_tools. Use for operations that
delete or permanently modify resources. Requires intent.operation_type='destructive'.
Most permissive - allowed regardless of server annotations."
```
