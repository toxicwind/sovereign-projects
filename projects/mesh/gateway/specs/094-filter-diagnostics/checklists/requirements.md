# Specification Quality Checklist: retrieve_tools Filter Diagnostics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — *with documented deviation, see Notes*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Field names (`filter_diagnostics`, `matched_before_filters`, parameter names like `read_only_only`) appear in the spec because they ARE the user-facing contract of this API feature, not implementation detail — same convention as specs 049/085.
- Filter-semantics fidelity (read-only-implies-non-destructive edge case) is stated as an observable-behavior constraint, not as code guidance.
- Revised after cross-model (Codex) spec review round 1 (2026-08-10), which returned NEEDS_CHANGES with 8 required changes; all applied: `omitted_servers` deferred (scope + stale-quarantine-index leak + unbounded size), normative JSON shape added (FR-003), candidate-window semantics replace the raw-`limit` claim, "cause precedence" replaces "dominant cause" (FR-006), FR-007 protects all fields non-exhaustively, all three registrations enumerated with the default-schema parameter gap closed (FR-009), FR-010 clarified to the `/mcp` code-execution routing response, SC-003 replaced with an exact serialized-byte bound.
- Revised again after review round 2: normative example reordered to match the alphabetical-ordering promise; SC-003 rebuilt as a reachable fixture with an ASCII-only suggestion so the 500-byte bound is exact; out-of-scope hits corrected to "entirely invisible" (they are NOT part of the locked-tools flow).
- **Documented deviation on "no implementation details"**: this feature IS an API response contract, so the spec necessarily names response/parameter fields, the three tool registrations, and test-level guarantees (golden/byte-identity) — the same convention as specs 049/085. FR-008's "no extra index queries / no persistence" is a user-facing performance promise stated in system-boundary terms, not a design mandate. Items are checked with this deviation on record rather than pretending the spec is implementation-blind.
- Checklist re-validated against the round-2 revision; all items pass with the documented deviation above.
