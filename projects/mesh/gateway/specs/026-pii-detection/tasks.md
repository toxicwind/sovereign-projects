## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Secrets) and US2 (File Paths) can proceed in parallel
  - US3 (Filtering) depends on US1 or US2 being complete (needs detection data)
  - US4 (CLI) depends on US3 (uses same filters)
  - US5 (Custom Patterns) can proceed independently after Foundation
  - US6 (Credit Cards) can proceed independently after Foundation
- **E2E Tests (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1-US4 completion (core functionality)
- **Documentation (Phase 10)**: Can start after US1, completed after all stories
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories and E2E tests being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```

### Within Each User Story

- Tests written FIRST (TDD per constitution)
- Pattern implementations in parallel
- Integration tasks after patterns complete
- Story checkpoint before moving on

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel
**Phase 2 (Foundation)**: T007-T009 (entropy, luhn, paths) + T014-T018 (tests) in parallel
**US1**: T019-T031 (tests) in parallel, then T032-T036 (patterns) in parallel
**US2**: T040-T048 (tests) in parallel, then T049-T053 (patterns) in parallel
**US3**: T056-T060 (API tests) in parallel, T065-T066 (UI components) in parallel
**US5-US6**: Can run in parallel as independent stories
**E2E**: T099-T107 can run in parallel (different test files)
**Docs**: T111-T116 can run in parallel (different files)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (13 test tasks):
Task: "Write table-driven tests for AWS credential patterns in internal/security/patterns/cloud_test.go"
Task: "Write table-driven tests for GCP API key patterns in internal/security/patterns/cloud_test.go"
Task: "Write table-driven tests for Azure credential patterns in internal/security/patterns/cloud_test.go"
Task: "Write table-driven tests for RSA/EC/DSA private key patterns in internal/security/patterns/keys_test.go"
# ... etc.

# After tests exist, launch all patterns in parallel:
Task: "Implement cloud credential patterns in internal/security/patterns/cloud.go"
Task: "Implement private key patterns in internal/security/patterns/keys.go"
Task: "Implement API token patterns in internal/security/patterns/tokens.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Secret Detection)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test secret detection independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can see secrets in Activity Log metadata

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Secrets) → Test → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (File Paths) → Test → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Filtering) → Test → Deploy/Demo (major UX improvement)
5. Add User Story 4 (CLI) → Test → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Custom Patterns) → Test → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 (Credit Cards) → Test → Deploy/Demo (PCI compliance)
8. Complete E2E Tests → Validate full integration
9. Complete Documentation → Publish to docs site
10. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Secrets)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (File Paths)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 or 6 (independent)
3. After US1 or US2 complete:
   - Developer A or B: User Story 3 (Filtering)
   - Developer C: Start Documentation (Phase 10)
4. After US3 complete:
   - Developer: User Story 4 (CLI)
5. After US1-US4 complete:
   - All: E2E Tests and Documentation finalization

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Pattern files can be developed in parallel within a story
- E2E tests validate full integration before documentation
- Documentation uses Docusaurus format with frontmatter
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
