# Tasks: Activity Log Backend

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-activity-log-backend/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included per constitution (TDD requirement - V. Test-Driven Development)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Following Go project structure from plan.md:
- Storage: `internal/storage/`
- Runtime: `internal/runtime/`
- HTTP API: `internal/httpapi/`
- Contracts: `internal/contracts/`
- MCP Server: `internal/server/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 and can proceed in parallel
  - US3 depends on US1 (needs list endpoint pattern)
  - US4 depends on storage layer from Phase 2
- **Data Management (Phase 7)**: Can start after Foundational, parallel to user stories
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Parallel With |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| US1 (P1) | Foundational | US2 |
| US2 (P1) | Foundational | US1 |
| US3 (P2) | Foundational | US1, US2, US4 |
| US4 (P3) | Foundational | US1, US2, US3 |

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests written FIRST (TDD per constitution)
2. Handlers depend on storage methods
3. Routes depend on handlers
4. Integration depends on runtime wiring

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (all parallel):**
```
T001, T002, T003, T004 can run simultaneously
```

**Phase 2 (sequential with some parallel):**
```
T006 → T007 → T008, T009, T010, T011 (parallel) → T012, T013 → T014, T015
```

**User Stories (parallel between stories):**
```
After Phase 2 completes:
  Team A: US1 (T016-T025)
  Team B: US2 (T026-T029)

After US1:
  Continue: US3 (T030-T034)

After US3:
  Continue: US4 (T035-T039)
```

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# Launch all setup tasks together:
Task: "Define ActivityType enum and ActivityRecord struct in internal/storage/activity_models.go"
Task: "Define ActivityFilter struct in internal/storage/activity_models.go"
Task: "Add activity event types to internal/runtime/events.go"
Task: "Define API request/response types in internal/contracts/activity.go"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch US1 tests together:
Task: "Write test for handleListActivity in internal/httpapi/activity_test.go"
Task: "Write E2E test for GET /api/v1/activity in internal/server/activity_e2e_test.go"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T025)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test activity list API independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can now query tool call history!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Storage layer ready
2. Add US1 → Activity list API functional → **MVP Demo**
3. Add US2 → Real-time SSE events → Enhanced monitoring
4. Add US3 → Detail view → Debugging capability
5. Add US4 → Export → Compliance ready
6. Add Data Management → Production ready
7. Polish → Documentation complete

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + User Story 1**
- Total: 25 tasks (T001-T025)
- Deliverable: REST API to query tool call history with filtering and pagination
- Value: Core visibility into AI agent activity

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests follow TDD - write and verify they FAIL before implementation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution requires tests (V. TDD) and docs update (VI. Documentation Hygiene)
