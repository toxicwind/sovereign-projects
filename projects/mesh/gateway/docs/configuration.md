## Configuration File Location

MCPProxy looks for configuration in these locations (in order):

| OS          | Config Location                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**   | `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json`             |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%\.mcpproxy\mcp_config.json` |
| **Linux**   | `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json`             |

**Note:** At first launch, MCPProxy automatically generates a minimal configuration file if none exists.

### Hot-Reload on File Edits

A running MCPProxy core watches `mcp_config.json` and hot-reloads external edits automatically — whether written in place (`echo ... > mcp_config.json`) or atomically (`jq ... > tmp && mv tmp mcp_config.json`, the pattern most editors use). Behavior details:

- Edits are debounced for ~500 ms, so rapid write bursts collapse into a single reload.
- Invalid JSON is rejected safely: the running configuration is kept unchanged (a warning is logged) and the watcher picks up the next valid write.
- MCPProxy's own saves (Web UI, REST `PATCH /api/v1/config`, CLI commands) do not trigger a redundant second reload.
- Restart-required fields (e.g. `listen`, `data_dir`) are reloaded into memory but only take effect after a restart.

## Basic Configuration

### Network Binding

```json
{
  "listen": "127.0.0.1:8080"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `listen` | string | `"127.0.0.1:8080"` | Network address to bind to. Use `:8080` for all interfaces, `127.0.0.1:8080` for localhost only (recommended for security) |

**Examples:**
- `"127.0.0.1:8080"` - Localhost only (default, secure)
- `":8080"` - All network interfaces (use with caution)
- `"0.0.0.0:9000"` - All interfaces on port 9000

### Data Directory

```json
{
  "data_dir": "~/.mcpproxy"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `data_dir` | string | `"~/.mcpproxy"` | Directory for database and certificates. Supports `~` expansion for home directory. Logs use OS log directories unless `log_dir` is set |

### Tray Application

```json
{
  "enable_socket": true,
  "tray_endpoint": ""
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_socket` | boolean | `true` | Enable Unix socket (macOS/Linux) or named pipe (Windows) for secure local IPC between tray and core |
| `tray_endpoint` | string | `""` | Override socket/pipe path (advanced, usually not needed) |

### Search & Tool Limits

```json
{
  "tools_limit": 15,
  "tool_response_limit": 20000,
  "call_tool_timeout": "2m",
  "init_timeout": "30s"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tools_limit` | integer | `15` | Maximum number of tools to return per request (1-1000) |
| `tool_response_limit` | integer | `20000` | Maximum characters in tool responses (0 = unlimited). Applies to built-in tools too: an oversize `retrieve_tools` result is truncated and the full payload is retrievable via `read_cache` (except on the code-execution surface, which does not expose `read_cache`) |
| `call_tool_timeout` | string | `"2m"` | Timeout for tool calls (e.g., `"30s"`, `"2m"`, `"5m"`). **Note**: When using agents like Codex or Claude as MCP servers, you may need to increase this timeout significantly, even up to 10 minutes (`"10m"`), as these agents may require longer processing times for complex operations |
| `init_timeout` | duration | `"30s"` | Deadline for an upstream's MCP `initialize` handshake (e.g. `"30s"`, `"120s"`, `"3m"`). Raise this for servers that do legitimate first-run warmup — building a cache/index or prefetching — before they answer `initialize`, so they are not killed mid-startup. Global default; can be overridden per server (see [Server Fields](#server-fields)). Range: `1s`–`30m`; `"0s"`/unset uses the 30s default. |

### HTTP Server Timeouts

Deadlines applied to mcpproxy's own HTTP listener (REST API, `/mcp`, `/events`).
These are separate from `call_tool_timeout`, which caps how long an *upstream
tool* may run.

```json
{
  "http_read_timeout": "120s",
  "http_write_timeout": "120s",
  "http_idle_timeout": "180s"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `http_read_timeout` | duration | `"120s"` | Deadline for reading the entire request (headers + body). `"0s"` = no timeout. Range: `1s`–`24h`. |
| `http_write_timeout` | duration | `"120s"` | Wall-clock cap on writing the entire response, counted from when the request headers were read. **Governs non-streaming endpoints only** (REST API, Web UI, health) — the MCP endpoints and the SSE `/events` stream are exempt by design (see below, [#965](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/issues/965)). `"0s"` disables it globally. Range: `1s`–`24h`. |
| `http_idle_timeout` | duration | `"180s"` | Keep-alive timeout for idle persistent connections. `"0s"` removes the dedicated idle deadline, but Go's `net/http` then falls back to the read timeout — idle is fully unbounded only when `http_read_timeout` is also `"0s"`. Range: `1s`–`24h`. |

Notes:

- **Streaming routes are exempt from `http_write_timeout`.** A write deadline caps the whole response, so it would truncate any tool call slower than it and silently kill long-lived SSE streams. The MCP endpoints (`/mcp`, `/mcp/all`, `/mcp/code`, `/mcp/call`, `/mcp/p/<slug>`, plus the legacy `/v1/tool_code` and `/v1/tool-code` aliases) and `/events` therefore clear their own per-request write deadline (and, being body-less GETs, their read deadline). Everything else keeps the configured deadline, which is what protects a non-loopback deployment from slow readers. You do **not** need to disable `http_write_timeout` to run long tool calls ([#965](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/issues/965)).
- **`"0s"` means "no timeout"**, not "use the default" — unlike `init_timeout`. Omit the key entirely to get the built-in default. Setting `http_write_timeout` to `"0s"` removes the deadline from *every* endpoint, including REST/UI/health. Exception: `http_idle_timeout: "0s"` alone does not unbound idle connections — Go's `net/http` falls back to the read timeout (see the field row above).
- **A restart is required.** These values are baked into the HTTP server when it binds, so a config edit is reported as restart-required rather than hot-reloaded.
- **Slowloris protection is unaffected**: the 60s request-header read deadline is hardcoded and not configurable.
- **Long tool calls need `call_tool_timeout`.** It (default `"2m"`) separately caps tool execution. To allow tool calls longer than two minutes, raise `call_tool_timeout` — the MCP routes' write-deadline exemption alone is not enough.

Environment overrides: `MCPPROXY_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT`, `MCPPROXY_HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT`, `MCPPROXY_HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

### TOON Output (Adaptive Result Encoding)

```json
{
  "toon_output": "adaptive",
  "toon_min_savings_pct": 15
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `toon_output` | string | `"off"` | TOON encoding of `call_tool_*` result text blocks: `off` (byte-identical to pre-feature behavior), `adaptive` (encode only tabular-uniform JSON when the complete TOON emission — marker + decode hint + body — beats the passthrough by at least `toon_min_savings_pct`; never larger by construction), or `always` (encode every JSON-parseable block regardless of size — **benchmarking/debugging only, can increase token cost**). Hot-reloads; applies to the next tool call without restart. |
| `toon_min_savings_pct` | integer | `15` | Minimum byte savings (percent, 1–90) the TOON emission must achieve over the passthrough for `adaptive` mode to encode. Byte savings approximate token savings for this payload class. |

Per-server override: set `toon_output` on a server entry to override the global for that server's tools (precedence: per-server > global > default `off`). See [Server Fields](#server-fields) and [TOON Output](features/toon-output.md) for the full feature description (marker contract, safety chain, decision metadata).

### Discovery & Health Checks

mcpproxy keeps each upstream connection alive and its tool index fresh with two
background loops. Both intervals are tunable globally and per server, so you can
quiet a chatty upstream that returns a large tool catalog.

```json
{
  "health_check_interval": "30s",
  "tool_discovery_interval": "5m"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `health_check_interval` | duration | `"30s"` | How often to probe each connected server for liveness with a lightweight MCP `ping`. `"0s"` disables the periodic probe. Range: `5s`–`1h`. **Does not apply to Docker-isolated servers** (see note below). |
| `tool_discovery_interval` | duration | `"5m"` | How often to re-list every server's tools to rebuild the search index. `"0s"` disables the periodic sweep. Range: `30s`–`24h`. Applies to all server types, including Docker. |

> **Docker-isolated servers.** `health_check_interval` has **no effect** on
> Docker-isolated servers. Their liveness is monitored separately at the
> container level on a fixed internal cadence (not an MCP `ping`), so the
> periodic ping probe is intentionally skipped for them. `tool_discovery_interval`
> still applies to Docker servers. Remote (HTTP/SSE) servers benefit most from
> the `ping` switch, since both the probe and the former `tools/list` crossed
> the network.

**Liveness uses `ping`, not `tools/list`.** The health-check loop issues the
MCP-standard `ping` request rather than re-listing every tool, so an idle proxy
no longer generates large recurring `tools/list` traffic to upstream servers
(GitHub [#608](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/issues/608)). Tool
changes are still picked up reactively whenever a server pushes
`notifications/tools/list_changed`.

**Disabling a loop (`"0s"`).** Set either key to `"0s"` to turn the
corresponding loop off:

- `health_check_interval: "0s"` — no periodic liveness probe. A dead transport
  is then detected lazily, on the next real tool call or discovery sweep, rather
  than proactively.
- `tool_discovery_interval: "0s"` — no periodic index rebuild. Tools are still
  discovered at connect time and whenever a server pushes
  `notifications/tools/list_changed`. **Trade-off:** a server that does *not*
  support `list_changed` will not have new/removed tools reflected until it
  reconnects or you trigger a manual refresh.

An unset key behaves exactly as before this feature (the built-in default), and
a change to either interval takes effect on the next cycle without restarting
the proxy.

> **Per-server override.** Both keys can also be set on an individual server
> entry under `mcpServers[]` (see [Server Fields](#server-fields)) to override
> the global value for just that server; the per-server value wins, and `"0s"`
> disables the loop for that server only. A dedicated per-server form control in
> the Web UI / macOS app is planned; for now set per-server overrides via the
> Raw JSON editor or the REST API.

### Concurrency Limits & Request Queueing

Multi-user or multi-agent deployments can overwhelm a fragile upstream (a
database-backed stdio server, a rate-limited API) with simultaneous tool calls.
MCPProxy can cap how many upstream tool calls run at once and park the excess in
a bounded FIFO queue, shedding predictably when that queue is full
(GitHub [#955](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/issues/955)).

**Everything is off by default** — with no keys set, behavior is exactly as
before: no limiting, no queueing, no new errors.

There are **three separately named scopes**, each carrying the same three
settings:

| Scope | Where | What it caps |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Global aggregate limiter | top-level `max_concurrent_requests` / `queue_size` / `queue_timeout` | All upstream tool calls across the whole proxy |
| Per-server default set | `server_concurrency_defaults` object | Blanket per-server values, inherited by every server that does not override them |
| Per-server override | the same three keys on an `mcpServers[]` entry | That one server |

```json
{
  "max_concurrent_requests": 50,
  "queue_size": 100,
  "queue_timeout": "30s",

  "server_concurrency_defaults": {
    "max_concurrent_requests": 5,
    "queue_size": 10,
    "queue_timeout": "30s"
  },

  "mcpServers": [
    { "name": "fragile-db", "command": "db-mcp", "max_concurrent_requests": 1, "queue_size": 2 },
    { "name": "fast-api", "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp", "max_concurrent_requests": 0 }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_concurrent_requests` | integer | unset (off) | Maximum upstream tool calls running at once in this scope. `0` (or unset) = no limiter for this scope. |
| `queue_size` | integer | `0` | How many calls may wait for a slot. `0` = no pending capacity: a call arriving at the cap is shed immediately. |
| `queue_timeout` | duration | `"30s"` when a limiter is active | How long a call may wait in the queue before being shed. |

**Tri-state per-server semantics.** Each per-server key is independently
tri-state:

- **absent** — inherit the value from `server_concurrency_defaults`;
- **`0`** — disable that setting for this server. `max_concurrent_requests: 0`
  opts the server out of per-server limiting entirely (even when the default set
  configures one); `queue_size: 0` keeps the cap but removes the queue, so
  excess calls are shed instantly;
- **positive** — override the default for this server.

The global aggregate limiter is **never** an inheritance source for a server.
It applies *on top*: a server's effective concurrency is
**min(resolved per-server limit, global limit)**. Waiting for a per-server slot
does not consume global capacity — the per-server slot is taken first.

**One deadline, not two.** `queue_timeout` is a total wait budget, not a
per-tier one: a call waiting for a per-server slot and then a global slot shares
a single absolute deadline (the smallest configured timeout among the active
scopes). Queue waiting never consumes the call's execution timeout — the
execution budget starts after admission.

**Recommended starting point for stdio upstreams: `5`.** stdio does not mean
serial: the MCP stdio transport multiplexes by JSON-RPC id and common SDK
servers process calls through a small worker pool, so `5` mirrors typical
upstream capacity. Drop to `1` only for a server you know is single-threaded or
backed by a fragile store.

**Shedding.** A shed call is reported as a readable, retry-friendly error rather
than a dropped connection: MCP tool calls get an error tool result, the REST
tool-call endpoint returns `429` with `Retry-After`, and the activity log
records the call with a `rejected` status carrying the reason (`queue_full` or
`queue_timeout`) and scope (`server` or `global`).

**Batched sandbox calls.** A `call_tools()` batch from
[code execution](#code-execution) goes through the same admission path, so these
limits are never bypassed by batching. A server capped at
`max_concurrent_requests: 1` with `queue_size: 9` serializes a 10-element batch;
the same server with **no** `queue_size` returns one result and nine per-slot
`queue_full` errors. Give servers you fan out against enough `queue_size`
headroom (or keep `code_execution_max_parallel` at their cap).

**Hot reload.** All limits are hot-reloadable — edit the config file and the new
values govern subsequent admissions without a restart. Running calls are never
interrupted, but they keep counting against the new caps: after lowering a cap,
nothing new is admitted until occupancy drains below it. Raising a cap admits
waiting calls immediately; queued calls keep their original deadline.

**Validation.** Negative values are rejected, as is a positive `queue_size` in a
scope whose `max_concurrent_requests` resolves to disabled (a queue in front of
no limiter can never admit anything). Errors name the offending scope and field.
The exception is the documented opt-out above: an explicit per-server
`max_concurrent_requests: 0` is valid even when the default set defines a queue.

Only the **global aggregate** scope has environment overrides
(`MCPPROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `MCPPROXY_QUEUE_SIZE`,
`MCPPROXY_QUEUE_TIMEOUT`); the default set and per-server overrides are
file/API-configured.

**Per-server limits over REST.** `POST /api/v1/servers` and
`PATCH /api/v1/servers/{name}` accept `max_concurrent_requests`, `queue_size`
and `queue_timeout` alongside the other per-server fields, and
`GET /api/v1/servers` echoes them back. All three keep tri-state semantics on
PATCH: omitting a key leaves the stored value alone, and an explicit `0` is the
documented opt-out — it is applied, not treated as "unset".

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/servers/fragile-db \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MCPPROXY_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"max_concurrent_requests": 1, "queue_size": 2, "queue_timeout": "10s"}'
```

**What is limited, and what is not.** Limits apply to *upstream tool calls* from
every in-process origin — the `call_tool_*` variants, direct-routing mode, the
REST `POST /api/v1/tools/call` endpoint, sandboxed `code_execution` scripts and
activity replay. Local tool search, coalesced tool listings and health probes
are never throttled: they are lightweight and must not be able to queue behind a
saturated upstream. The separate-process CLI debug client is out of scope.

**Observability.** Saturation is visible on the Prometheus surface:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| `mcpproxy_tool_calls_rejected_total` | counter | `server`, `reason`, `scope` | Calls shed by a limit. `reason` = `queue_full` \| `queue_timeout`; `scope` = `server` \| `global`. `server` is the call's target even for a global shed. |
| `mcpproxy_concurrency_active` | gauge | `scope`, `server` | Calls currently holding a slot. |
| `mcpproxy_concurrency_queue_depth` | gauge | `scope`, `server` | Calls currently waiting for a slot. |

Gauges are sampled every 10s; the counter is exact — it is incremented at the
rejection itself, not derived from the internal event stream, so a burst of
sheds cannot lose increments. The same sheds also appear in the activity log
(`status: rejected`) — written on the same synchronous path, and exactly one row
per shed — including the ones from `code_execution` and replay: the rejection is
recorded at the limiter, below the MCP dispatch layer, so no origin can bypass
it and none can double-report it.

### Debug & Development

```json
{
  "debug_search": false,
  "enable_prompts": true,
  "aggregate_upstream_prompts": false,
  "check_server_repo": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `debug_search` | boolean | `false` | Enable debug logging for search operations |
| `enable_prompts` | boolean | `true` | Enable mcpproxy's built-in prompts (setup / troubleshoot workflows) and advertise the MCP `prompts` capability. Governs only the built-ins; upstream aggregation is controlled separately by `aggregate_upstream_prompts`. |
| `aggregate_upstream_prompts` | boolean | `false` | **Opt-in.** When `true`, aggregate every connected upstream server's MCP prompts into mcpproxy's own `prompts/list` (exposed as `<server>__<prompt>`). Off by default so users are safe until they deliberately enable it. Requires `enable_prompts: true` (the default) to have any effect. Hot-reloadable. The per-server [`expose_prompts`](#per-server-settings) override further filters which servers contribute once this is on. |
| `check_server_repo` | boolean | `true` | Enable repository detection for MCP servers (shows install commands) |

## Server Configuration

### Basic Server Structure

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "my-server",
      "protocol": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"],
      "working_dir": "/path/to/project",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "secret-value"
      },
      "enabled": true,
      "quarantined": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Server Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique server identifier |
| `protocol` | string | No | Transport protocol: `stdio`, `http`, `sse`, `streamable-http`, or `auto` (default: inferred from `command`/`url`) |
| `command` | string | Yes* | Command to execute (required for `stdio` protocol) |
| `args` | array | No | Command arguments |
| `url` | string | Yes* | Server URL (required for `http`/`sse`/`streamable-http` protocols) |
| `headers` | object | No | HTTP headers for HTTP-based protocols |
| `working_dir` | string | No | Working directory for stdio servers, or for the locally-launched child of an HTTP/SSE server (default: current directory) |
| `env` | object | No | Environment variables for stdio servers, or for the locally-launched child of an HTTP/SSE server |
| `launcher_wait_timeout` | duration | No | When `command` is set together with an HTTP/SSE `url`, how long mcpproxy waits for that URL to become reachable after spawning the child (e.g. `"15s"`, default `"30s"`) |
| `health_check_interval` | duration | No | Per-server override for the global [`health_check_interval`](#discovery--health-checks). `"0s"` disables the liveness probe for this server only. Range: `5s`–`1h`. Omit to inherit the global value. |
| `tool_discovery_interval` | duration | No | Per-server override for the global [`tool_discovery_interval`](#discovery--health-checks). Overrides the global/default cadence for this server only; `"0s"` disables the periodic tool-discovery sweep for this server (connect-time and reactive `list_changed` discovery still run). Range: `30s`–`24h`. Omit to inherit the global value. |
| `init_timeout` | duration | No | Per-server override for the global [`init_timeout`](#search--tool-limits) — the MCP `initialize` handshake deadline. Raise it for an upstream that warms up (caches/indexes data) before responding to `initialize` (e.g. `"120s"`, `"3m"`); without it such a server is killed mid-startup and, with `docker run --rm`, retries forever. Range: `1s`–`30m`. Omit to inherit the global value (30s default). Settable via the `upstream_servers` tool and `mcpproxy upstream patch --init-timeout`. |
| `max_concurrent_requests` | integer | No | Per-server cap on concurrently running upstream tool calls (see [Concurrency Limits & Request Queueing](#concurrency-limits--request-queueing)). Omit to inherit `server_concurrency_defaults`; `0` opts this server out of per-server limiting; positive = that cap. The global limiter still applies on top. |
| `queue_size` | integer | No | How many calls may wait for this server's slot. Omit to inherit the default set; `0` = no pending capacity (shed immediately at the cap). |
| `queue_timeout` | duration | No | How long a call may wait for this server's slot (e.g. `"10s"`). Omit to inherit the default set (30s when a limiter is active). |
| `oauth` | object | No | OAuth configuration (see [OAuth Configuration](#oauth-configuration)) |
| `isolation` | object | No | Per-server Docker isolation settings (see [Docker Isolation](#docker-isolation)) |
| `enabled` | boolean | No | Enable/disable server (default: `true`) |
| `quarantined` | boolean | No | Security quarantine status (default: `false` for manually added servers, `true` for LLM-added servers) |
| `reconnect_on_use` | boolean | No | When `true`, tool calls to a disconnected server trigger an immediate reconnect attempt (15s timeout) before failing (default: `false`) |
| `expose_prompts` | boolean | No | Per-server override for whether this server's MCP prompts are aggregated into mcpproxy's `prompts/list`. Only takes effect when the global `aggregate_upstream_prompts` master switch is on. Omit to expose prompts whenever the server advertises `Capabilities.Prompts`; `false` opts this server out even if it does. |
| `toon_output` | string | No | Per-server override for the global [`toon_output`](#toon-output-adaptive-result-encoding): `off`, `adaptive`, or `always`. Non-empty value wins over the global for this server's tools; omit to inherit. See [TOON Output](features/toon-output.md). |
| `created` | string | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (auto-generated) |
| `updated` | string | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (auto-updated) |

### Protocol Types

**stdio** - Standard input/output (local processes):
```json
{
  "name": "local-server",
  "protocol": "stdio",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-m", "my_mcp_server"],
  "working_dir": "/path/to/project"
}
```

**http** - HTTP transport:
```json
{
  "name": "remote-server",
  "protocol": "http",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer token"
  }
}
```

**sse** - Server-Sent Events:
```json
{
  "name": "sse-server",
  "protocol": "sse",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp/sse"
}
```

**streamable-http** - Streamable HTTP (MCP standard):
```json
{
  "name": "streamable-server",
  "protocol": "streamable-http",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp"
}
```

**auto** - Auto-detect from `command` or `url`:
```json
{
  "name": "auto-server",
  "protocol": "auto",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "my-server"]
}
```

### Locally-launched HTTP / SSE servers

By default `command` is only used for `stdio` servers. When you set `command`
together with an HTTP/SSE `url` and an explicit `protocol` of `http`, `sse`,
or `streamable-http`, mcpproxy will:

1. Spawn the command (with `args`, `env`, `working_dir`, and Docker isolation
   exactly like a stdio server).
2. Wait up to `launcher_wait_timeout` (default 30s) for `url` to accept a TCP
   connection.
3. Connect via the configured HTTP/SSE transport.
4. Own the child's lifecycle — the process is stopped (`SIGTERM`, then
   `SIGKILL` after a grace period) on disconnect, restart, server-disable, or
   mcpproxy shutdown. Unexpected exits trigger an automatic disconnect, which
   the existing reconnect path picks up.

```json
{
  "name": "local-http-mcp",
  "protocol": "http",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9999/mcp",
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["./examples/echo-http-server.js", "--port", "9999"],
  "working_dir": "/path/to/repo",
  "launcher_wait_timeout": "15s",
  "enabled": true
}
```

`stdout` and `stderr` of the child are routed to the per-server log, so
`mcpproxy upstream logs <name>` continues to work the same way it does for
stdio servers.

#### Behaviour matrix when both `command` and `url` are set

| `protocol` | `command` | `url` | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stdio` (explicit) | set | any | Stdio transport, child via stdin/stdout — `url` ignored. |
| `http` / `sse` / `streamable-http` (explicit) | set | set | **Locally-launched HTTP/SSE** — spawn child, wait for URL, connect via network. |
| `http` / `sse` / `streamable-http` (explicit) | unset | set | Connect to remote URL — no spawn. |
| `auto` or unset | set | any | Stdio (`command` wins over `url` for back-compat — set `protocol` explicitly to opt into the launcher). |
| `auto` or unset | unset | set | HTTP/SSE remote — no spawn. |

The "command wins" rule under `auto` is intentional: it preserves backwards
compatibility with configurations written before the launcher feature
existed. To launch a local HTTP/SSE server you **must** set `protocol`
explicitly to one of `http`, `sse`, or `streamable-http`.

### OAuth Configuration

```json
{
  "oauth": {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "client_secret": "secret-reference",
    "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback",
    "scopes": ["repo", "user"],
    "pkce_enabled": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `client_id` | string | No | OAuth client ID (uses Dynamic Client Registration if empty) |
| `client_secret` | string | No | OAuth client secret (can reference secure storage) |
| `redirect_uri` | string | No | OAuth redirect URI (auto-generated if not provided) |
| `scopes` | array | No | OAuth scopes to request |
| `pkce_enabled` | boolean | No | PKCE is always enabled for security; this flag is currently ignored |

See [OAuth Documentation](mcp-go-oauth.md) for complete details.

## Security Settings

```json
{
  "api_key": "your-secret-api-key",
  "trusted_hosts": ["mcp.example.com"],
  "read_only_mode": false,
  "disable_management": false,
  "allow_server_add": true,
  "allow_server_remove": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `api_key` | string | Auto-generated | API key for REST API authentication. Required; if empty, one is auto-generated and enforced (logged on startup) |
| `trusted_hosts` | string[] | `[]` | Non-loopback `Host` header values accepted on loopback listeners (reverse-proxy deployments). See below |
| `read_only_mode` | boolean | `false` | Prevent all configuration modifications |
| `disable_management` | boolean | `false` | Disable server management operations (restart, enable, disable) |
| `allow_server_add` | boolean | `true` | Allow adding new servers via API/tools |
| `allow_server_remove` | boolean | `true` | Allow removing servers via API/tools |

**Security Notes:**
- **API Key**: Set via `--api-key` flag, `MCPPROXY_API_KEY` environment variable, or config file
- **Empty API Key**: Empty values are replaced with an auto-generated key; authentication is always enforced
- **Auto-Generation**: If no API key is provided, one is generated and logged for easy access
- **Tray Integration**: Tray app automatically manages API keys for core communication

### Reverse Proxy Deployments (`trusted_hosts`)

When mcpproxy listens on a loopback address (the default `127.0.0.1:8080`), DNS-rebinding
protection rejects any request whose `Host` header is not itself a loopback address with
`403 Forbidden: invalid Host header`. This blocks malicious websites from rebinding their
domain to `127.0.0.1` and driving a victim's browser into the local MCP server — but it
also blocks legitimate reverse proxies (nginx, Caddy, CloudPanel) that forward the public
domain in the `Host` header.

Add the public domain(s) to `trusted_hosts` to allow them:

```json
{
  "listen": "127.0.0.1:8004",
  "trusted_hosts": ["mcp.example.com"]
}
```

- Entries are hostnames, matched case-insensitively. An entry without a port matches that
  host on **any** port; an entry with a port (`"mcp.example.com:8443"`) requires an exact
  port match.
- A leading dot makes an entry a subdomain wildcard: `".example.com"` matches
  `example.com` and every subdomain of it (Django/Vite convention).
- The single entry `"*"` disables Host and Origin validation entirely. **Not
  recommended** — it re-opens DNS-rebinding: any website the local user visits could
  drive requests into the proxy.
- A request that carries an `Origin` header must likewise have a loopback or trusted
  origin host (MCP spec requirement); requests without `Origin` (non-browser clients,
  reverse proxies) are never rejected by the Origin check.
- Loopback hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) are always accepted; requests on
  non-loopback listeners are never subject to Host validation.
- Environment override: `MCPPROXY_TRUSTED_HOSTS` (comma-separated list).
- Hot-reloadable: editing the config file applies without a restart.

With `trusted_hosts` configured, a standard nginx block works without overriding `Host`:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8004;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_buffering off;
}
```

See [Reverse Proxy Deployment](operations/reverse-proxy.md) for a full guide covering
nginx and Caddy examples, streaming/SSE buffering, and enabling `require_mcp_auth` when
exposing MCPProxy beyond localhost.

### Security Scanner (`security`)

The deterministic, offline `tpa-descriptions` baseline scanner always runs and is
the sole source of the approval verdict. The heavier Docker-based scanner plugins
and published-package-source extraction live behind the **opt-in `security.deep_scan`
block** — off by default, best-effort, and unable to change the baseline verdict
(Spec 077).

```json
{
  "security": {
    "scan_timeout_default": "60s",
    "integrity_check_interval": "1h",
    "integrity_check_on_restart": false,
    "scanner_registry_url": "",
    "tpa_bundle_path": "",
    "deep_scan": {
      "enabled": false,
      "fetch_package_source": true,
      "disable_no_new_privileges": false,
      "scanners": []
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tpa_bundle_path` | string | `""` (embedded) | Filesystem path to the tpa-db `scanner-bundle.json` the offline TPA scanner runs. Empty uses the corpus embedded in the build. Env override: `MCPPROXY_TPA_BUNDLE_PATH`, which wins over this field on every path (loader, hot-reload, `/api/v1/config/apply`). Re-read on config hot-reload and honoured in every transport, stdio included. A bundle that fails to read/parse/version-check/compile — or that contributes zero runnable rules — is refused and the previously active corpus stays live; the reason is surfaced as `signature_bundle.load_error` in `GET /api/v1/security/overview` and in `mcpproxy security overview`. |
| `deep_scan.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master opt-in for the heavy layer. When `false`, no Docker scanner runs and no source extraction is attempted — only the in-process baseline scanner executes. |
| `deep_scan.fetch_package_source` | boolean | `true` (when deep scan is on) | Whether the scanner fetches (never executes) the published source of `npx`/`uvx` package-runner servers when no local source is available. Set `false` for air-gapped deployments. |
| `deep_scan.disable_no_new_privileges` | boolean | `false` | Omits `--security-opt no-new-privileges` from scanner container runs (snap-docker/AppArmor escape hatch). |
| `deep_scan.scanners` | string[] | `[]` | Optional allow-list of deep scanner ids. Empty ⇒ all enabled deep scanners are eligible. |

**Deprecated-key migration.** The old top-level `security.scanner_fetch_package_source`
and `security.scanner_disable_no_new_privileges` keys still parse and are migrated
into `security.deep_scan.*` on load. The former `security.auto_scan_quarantined`
key was **removed**; a config still carrying it loads without error and the key is
ignored.

See [Security Scanner Plugins](features/security-scanner-plugins.md#configuration) for the full scanner configuration reference.

## Tokenizer Configuration

The tokenizer provides **local token counting** using the tiktoken library. It does **not** access LLMs or make API calls—it's purely for counting tokens in text locally.

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_model": "gpt-4",
    "encoding": "cl100k_base"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable token counting |
| `default_model` | string | `"gpt-4"` | Default model name for tokenization (used to determine encoding when model not specified) |
| `encoding` | string | `"cl100k_base"` | Default tiktoken encoding to use |

### How Tokenizer Works

**Important:** The tokenizer does **not** access LLMs. It performs local token counting using the tiktoken algorithm:

1. **Local Processing**: All token counting happens locally using the tiktoken library
2. **No Network Calls**: No API requests or external services are used
3. **Model Mapping**: The `default_model` field is used to look up the appropriate encoding via `GetEncodingForModel()`
4. **Encoding Selection**: If a model isn't recognized, it falls back to the `encoding` field or `cl100k_base`

### Supported Models & Encodings

The tokenizer automatically maps model names to encodings:

**GPT-4o Series** (uses `o200k_base`):
- `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.5`, `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`

**GPT-4 & GPT-3.5 Series** (uses `cl100k_base`):
- `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`, `text-embedding-ada-002`, etc.

**Claude Models** (uses `cl100k_base` as approximation):
- `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus`, `claude-3-sonnet`, `claude-3-haiku`, `claude-2.1`, `claude-2.0`, `claude-instant`
- **Note**: Claude models use `cl100k_base` as an approximation. For accurate counts, use Anthropic's `count_tokens` API.

**Codex Series** (uses `p50k_base`):
- `code-davinci-002`, `code-davinci-001`, `code-cushman-002`, `code-cushman-001`

**Older GPT-3 Series** (uses `r50k_base`):
- `text-davinci-003`, `text-davinci-002`, `davinci`, `curie`, `babbage`, `ada`

### Supported Encodings

| Encoding | Models | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `o200k_base` | GPT-4o, GPT-4.5 | Latest OpenAI models |
| `cl100k_base` | GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude (approx) | Most common encoding |
| `p50k_base` | Codex | Code generation models |
| `r50k_base` | GPT-3 | Legacy models |

### Usage Examples

**For GPT-4:**
```json
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_model": "gpt-4",
    "encoding": "cl100k_base"
  }
}
```

**For Claude Models:**
```json
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "encoding": "cl100k_base"
  }
}
```

**For GPT-4o:**
```json
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_model": "gpt-4o",
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

**Disable Token Counting:**
```json
{
  "tokenizer": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### What Tokenizer Is Used For

- **Token Usage Tracking**: Counts tokens in MCP tool calls and responses
- **Token Savings Calculation**: Calculates token savings from caching
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Provides token metrics for observability
- **Response Truncation**: Helps determine when to truncate large responses

## TLS/HTTPS Configuration

```json
{
  "tls": {
    "enabled": false,
    "require_client_cert": false,
    "certs_dir": "",
    "hsts": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable HTTPS/TLS |
| `require_client_cert` | boolean | `false` | Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication |
| `certs_dir` | string | `""` | Custom certificate directory (defaults to `${data_dir}/certs`) |
| `hsts` | boolean | `true` | Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security headers |

**Quick Setup:**
1. Trust certificate: `mcpproxy trust-cert`
2. Enable TLS: Set `"enabled": true` or `MCPPROXY_TLS_ENABLED=true`
3. Update client URLs to use `https://`

See [Setup Guide - HTTPS](setup.md#optional-https-setup) for complete details.

## Logging Configuration

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "enable_file": false,
    "enable_console": true,
    "filename": "main.log",
    "log_dir": "",
    "max_size": 10,
    "max_backups": 5,
    "max_age": 30,
    "compress": true,
    "json_format": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `level` | string | `"info"` | Log level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `enable_file` | boolean | `false` | Enable file logging |
| `enable_console` | boolean | `true` | Enable console logging |
| `filename` | string | `"main.log"` | Log filename |
| `log_dir` | string | `""` | Custom log directory (defaults to OS log root; see below) |
| `max_size` | integer | `10` | Maximum log file size in MB before rotation |
| `max_backups` | integer | `5` | Number of backup log files to keep |
| `max_age` | integer | `30` | Maximum age of log files in days |
| `compress` | boolean | `true` | Compress rotated log files |
| `json_format` | boolean | `false` | Use JSON format (useful for log aggregation) |

**Log Locations (defaults):**
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Logs/mcpproxy/main.log`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/state/mcpproxy/logs/main.log` (or `/var/log/mcpproxy` when running as root)
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mcpproxy\logs\main.log`
- **Per-server logs:** same directory, `server-{name}.log` (characters in the server name that aren't letters, digits, `.`, `-`, or `_` — such as the `/` in registry names like `io.github.evidai/polymarket-guard` — are sanitized to `_`, so the log is always a single flat file)
- **Custom:** set `log_dir` to override (supports `~` expansion)

**Behavior notes:**
- `mcpproxy serve` enables file logging by default unless `--log-to-file` is explicitly set to `false`

See [Logging Documentation](logging.md) for complete details.

## Docker Recovery

```json
{
  "docker_recovery": {
    "enabled": true,
    "check_intervals": ["2s", "5s", "10s", "30s", "60s"],
    "max_retries": 0,
    "notify_on_start": true,
    "notify_on_success": true,
    "notify_on_failure": true,
    "notify_on_retry": false,
    "persistent_state": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable Docker recovery monitoring |
| `check_intervals` | array | `["2s", "5s", "10s", "30s", "60s"]` | Exponential backoff intervals for health checks |

See [Docker Recovery Documentation](docker-recovery-phase3.md) for complete details.

---

## Environment Configuration

```json
{
  "environment": {
    "inherit_system_safe": true,
    "allowed_system_vars": [
      "PATH",
      "HOME",
      "TMPDIR",
      "NODE_PATH"
    ],
    "custom_vars": {
      "CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
    },
    "enhance_path": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `inherit_system_safe` | boolean | `true` | Inherit safe system environment variables |
| `allowed_system_vars` | array | See below | List of system variables to allow |
| `custom_vars` | object | `{}` | Custom environment variables to set |
| `enhance_path` | boolean | `false` | Enable PATH enhancement for Launchd scenarios |

**Default Allowed System Variables:**
- Core: `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, `TMP`, `SHELL`, `TERM`, `LANG`, `USER`, `USERNAME`
- Windows-specific: `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `PROGRAMFILES`, `SYSTEMROOT`, `COMSPEC`
- Unix/XDG: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
- Locale: all `LC_*` variables (e.g., `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, …)
- Custom additions: `custom_vars` merged on top

> **Proxy variables are never inherited by default.** `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`,
> `NO_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `FTP_PROXY` are deliberately excluded from the
> default allow-list because proxy URLs commonly embed credentials
> (`http://user:pass@proxy`). To forward them to upstream stdio servers, opt in
> with `forward_proxy_env` (see below).

### Proxy Environment Forwarding

```json
{
  "forward_proxy_env": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `forward_proxy_env` | boolean | `false` | Forward ambient proxy environment variables to spawned stdio upstream servers, with credentials redacted |

When `forward_proxy_env` is `true`, mcpproxy forwards the proxy variables present
in its own environment (`HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`,
`NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy`, `ALL_PROXY`/`all_proxy`, `FTP_PROXY`/`ftp_proxy` — both
spellings are recognized) to each spawned stdio upstream. Any userinfo
(`user:password@`) is **stripped** from the value before forwarding, so
credentials never reach upstream servers while the proxy host/port is preserved.
An explicitly configured proxy value (via `custom_vars` or a server's `env`)
always takes precedence and suppresses forwarding of the ambient value, including
the other-cased alias.

> **macOS GUI/launchd note:** when launched from the Dock/Launchpad or the login
> item, mcpproxy inherits a minimal environment that may not contain your proxy
> variables. In that case set the proxy explicitly under `custom_vars` or a
> server's `env` block.

---

## Routing Mode

Controls how upstream MCP tools are exposed to AI agents on the default `/mcp` endpoint.

```json
{
  "routing_mode": "retrieve_tools"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `routing_mode` | string | `"retrieve_tools"` | How tools are exposed: `retrieve_tools`, `direct`, or `code_execution` |

**Available modes:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `retrieve_tools` | BM25 search via `retrieve_tools` + `call_tool_read/write/destructive` (default, most token-efficient) |
| `direct` | All upstream tools exposed directly as `serverName__toolName` |
| `code_execution` | JavaScript orchestration via `code_execution` tool with tool catalog |

All three modes are always available on dedicated endpoints regardless of config: `/mcp/all` (direct), `/mcp/code` (code_execution), `/mcp/call` (retrieve_tools).

See [Routing Modes](features/routing-modes.md) for complete details.

---

## Tool Response Mode

Controls only the *serialization* of `retrieve_tools` responses (Spec 085) — never the query, ranking, or result set. Orthogonal to `routing_mode`.

```json
{
  "tool_response_mode": "full"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tool_response_mode` | string | `"full"` | `full` returns complete `inputSchema` entries (pre-Spec-085 behavior, byte-identical). `compact` returns one-line signatures instead: per entry `id`, `score`, `sig`, first-sentence `desc`, and a `lossy` flag, plus one top-level `hint` line. |

- **Compact signatures**: `*` marks a required parameter (never elided), `~` marks a lossy collapse (nested objects, long enums — call `describe_tool` for the full schema), short enums/defaults are inlined (e.g. `(origin*:str, ttl:int=3600)`).
- **Per-call override**: the `detail` parameter on `retrieve_tools` (`compact` | `full`) overrides the configured mode for that call only.
- **describe_tool**: in compact mode, agents fetch full definitions on demand with `describe_tool` (batch of 1–5 `server:tool` ids; same visibility rules as search).
- **Hot-reload**: changes apply on the next call via the config file reload or `POST /api/v1/config/apply` — no restart.
- Env: `MCPPROXY_TOOL_RESPONSE_MODE` · Flag: `--tool-response-mode`.

## Server Instructions

Text returned in the MCP `initialize` response to guide AI agents on how to use the proxy (e.g., use `retrieve_tools` to discover existing tools rather than `search_servers`).

```json
{
  "instructions": "Use retrieve_tools to discover tools before assuming a capability is unavailable."
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `instructions` | string | _(built-in)_ | Custom instructions sent in the MCP `initialize` response. When empty, a built-in default explains the `retrieve_tools` → `call_tool_*` workflow and warns against using `search_servers` for existing tools. |

You can edit this from the Web UI under **Settings → Advanced → MCP server instructions**. The textarea shows the built-in default as a greyed-out placeholder; clearing it restores that default.

**Note:** Applied at startup / on the next client connect — editing this value does not hot-reload into already-connected MCP sessions.

---

## Tool-Level Quarantine

SHA256 hash-based tool approval system that detects changes to tool descriptions and schemas.

```json
{
  "quarantine_enabled": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `quarantine_enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable tool-level quarantine globally |

Per-server tool-change auto-approval is configured on the server entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "trusted-server",
      "command": "my-server",
      "skip_quarantine": true
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_approve_tool_changes` | boolean (tri-state) | unset (= `false`) | Auto-approve **all** post-baseline tool changes AND additions for this server (disables per-server rug-pull protection). The active per-server control. A trusted server's *baseline* is auto-approved regardless of this flag. |
| `skip_quarantine` | boolean | `false` | **Deprecated** — superseded by `auto_approve_tool_changes`. A legacy `skip_quarantine: true` is migrated onto `auto_approve_tool_changes` on load **only when it is unset** (an explicit `false` overrides the legacy flag). |

See [Tool Quarantine](features/tool-quarantine.md) for complete details.

## Code Execution

```json
{
  "enable_code_execution": false,
  "code_execution_timeout_ms": 120000,
  "code_execution_max_tool_calls": 0,
  "code_execution_pool_size": 10,
  "code_execution_max_parallel": 8
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_code_execution` | boolean | `false` | Enable JavaScript/TypeScript code execution tool (disabled by default for security) |
| `code_execution_timeout_ms` | integer | `120000` | Default timeout in milliseconds (1-600000, max 10 minutes) |
| `code_execution_max_tool_calls` | integer | `0` | Maximum tool calls per execution (0 = unlimited) |
| `code_execution_pool_size` | integer | `10` | Number of JavaScript VM instances in pool (1-100) |
| `code_execution_max_parallel` | integer | `8` | Default concurrency for `call_tools()` batches (1-32). Hot-reloaded; applies to executions that start after the change |

Code execution supports both JavaScript (ES2020+) and TypeScript. TypeScript code is automatically transpiled via esbuild before execution.

Inside a script, `call_tool(server, tool, args)` runs one upstream tool at a time and `call_tools(requests, options)` fans out **independent** calls in parallel:

```javascript
var slots = call_tools([
  {server: "github", tool: "get_pull_request", args: {owner: "acme", repo: "api", pullNumber: 1}},
  {server: "github", tool: "get_pull_request", args: {owner: "acme", repo: "api", pullNumber: 2}}
], {max_parallel: 5});
// slots[i] is {ok: true, result} or {ok: false, error} for requests[i]
```

`requests` holds at most 100 elements; each costs one unit of `code_execution_max_tool_calls` budget. Concurrency precedence is `options.max_parallel` (1-32) > `code_execution_max_parallel` > built-in 8.

> **Batching vs. per-server limits.** [Concurrency limits](#concurrency-limits--request-queueing) still govern each element. A server with `max_concurrent_requests` set and **no** `queue_size` sheds everything over the cap — a 10-element batch against `max_concurrent_requests: 1` returns 1 result and 9 per-slot `queue_full` errors. Give such servers `queue_size` headroom (or lower `max_parallel`) before fanning out against them.

### Stored Scripts

Long workflows do not have to be re-sent inline on every call. A `<name>.js` / `<name>.ts` file placed in the `scripts/` directory **next to this configuration file** (`~/.mcpproxy/scripts/` by default, `<dir-of---config>/scripts/` when `--config` points elsewhere) is invocable by name — `{"script": "<name>", "input": {...}}` over MCP/REST, or `mcpproxy code exec --script <name>`.

There is no configuration key for this: the directory convention is the whole surface, and the scripts directory is never derived from `--data-dir`. Names are 1-64 characters of `A-Za-z0-9_-` (never a path), files are lowercase `.js`/`.ts` up to 256 KB, and each invocation re-reads the file, so an atomic replacement takes effect on the next run with no restart. `mcpproxy code scripts list` (or `GET /api/v1/code/scripts`) lists what exists; nothing writes scripts through any API.

See [Code Execution Documentation](code_execution/overview.md) for complete details, and [Stored Scripts](code_execution/overview.md#stored-scripts) for the authoring rules.

## Feature Flags

```json
{
  "features": {
    "enable_runtime": true,
    "enable_event_bus": true,
    "enable_sse": true,
    "enable_observability": true,
    "enable_health_checks": true,
    "enable_metrics": true,
    "enable_tracing": false,
    "enable_oauth": true,
    "enable_quarantine": true,

    "enable_async_storage": true,
    "enable_web_ui": true,
    "enable_debug_logging": false,
    "enable_contract_tests": false
  }
}
```

**Note:** Feature flags are typically managed internally. Most users don't need to modify these settings.

---

## Registries

The three default registries ship built-in and require no configuration. Use
the `registries` array only to **add your own** custom source:

```json
{
  "registries": [
    {
      "id": "mycorp",
      "name": "My Corp Registry",
      "description": "Internal MCP server catalog",
      "url": "https://registry.mycorp.example/",
      "servers_url": "https://registry.mycorp.example/v0.1/servers",
      "tags": ["internal"],
      "protocol": "modelcontextprotocol/registry"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique registry identifier |
| `name` | string | Display name |
| `description` | string | Registry description |
| `url` | string | Registry homepage |
| `servers_url` | string | API endpoint for server listings |
| `tags` | array | Registry tags (e.g., `["verified"]`) |
| `protocol` | string | Registry protocol type |
| `count` | number/string | Number of servers in registry (auto-populated) |

**SSRF guard (`allow_private_registry_fetch`).** Because the daemon fetches the
URL you configure, registry fetches refuse any host that is — or resolves to — a
non-routable address (loopback, RFC1918/CGNAT private, link-local including the
`169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata endpoint). This bounds CWE-918 request forgery
against internal services. Set this top-level flag to `true` **only** if you
intentionally run a trusted registry mirror on an internal/private address:

```json
{ "allow_private_registry_fetch": true }
```

> ⚠️ **The opt-out is blanket (all-or-nothing).** Setting it `true` lifts the
> guard for **every** non-routable range at once — loopback, RFC1918/CGNAT
> private, link-local **and** the `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata endpoint.
> There is no way to allow only loopback: enabling it for a localhost dev
> registry also re-opens the cloud-metadata SSRF vector (e.g.
> `registry add-source https://169.254.169.254/...` will then succeed). Enable
> it only for trusted local/dev use, ideally on hosts with no cloud-metadata
> exposure. The flag takes effect only on daemon (re)start / config reload.

Default `false` (secure). See [Registries Documentation](registries.md#adding-your-own-registry-source).

**Default Registries** (shipped built-in, no configuration required):
- `official` — Official MCP Registry (`modelcontextprotocol/registry`): primary, zero-config aggregator
- `reference` — Reference Servers (`builtin/reference`): curated `@modelcontextprotocol` servers, shipped in-binary so the basics work offline
- `docker-mcp-catalog` — Docker MCP Catalog (`custom/docker`): signed-container MCP server inventory

> **Deprecated former-defaults:** earlier versions also shipped `pulse`, `smithery`, `fleur`, `azure-mcp-demo`, and `remote-mcp-servers` as defaults. These were removed and are pruned from an existing `mcp_config.json` on load, so upgrades converge to the three defaults above. Genuinely user-added custom registries are never touched; `pulse`/`smithery` can be added back as custom sources.

See [Registries Documentation](registries.md) and [Search Servers Documentation](search_servers.md) for complete details.

---

## Observability

Controls the usage-statistics aggregate that powers the Web UI usage graphs
(spec 069). The aggregate is built incrementally from the activity log, kept in
memory as an immutable snapshot, and periodically persisted so it survives
restarts without a full re-scan.

```json
{
  "observability": {
    "usage_cache_ttl": "5s",
    "usage_persist_interval": "30s"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `usage_cache_ttl` | duration string | `5s` | Freshness bound for the usage endpoint's read cache on wide time windows. |
| `usage_persist_interval` | duration string | `30s` | How often the in-memory usage aggregate snapshot is flushed to storage (also flushed on graceful shutdown). |

Both fields are optional, accept Go duration strings (e.g. `"10s"`, `"1m"`),
and are hot-reloadable. Non-positive values fall back to the defaults.

---

## Update Check

Controls the background upgrade-awareness checker (Spec 079). MCPProxy
periodically queries GitHub Releases and surfaces "update available" on
`mcpproxy status` / `doctor`, a startup log line, the Web UI (sidebar badge +
dismissible banner), and the trays. Checks never block and fail silently when
offline.

```json
{
  "update_check": {
    "enabled": true,
    "channel": "stable"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch for update checking. When `false`, no network check is performed (background poll *and* the manual `/api/v1/info?refresh=true` re-check) and no upgrade nudge appears on any surface — the `update` object is omitted from `/api/v1/info`. |
| `channel` | string | `"stable"` | Release channel: `"stable"` (GitHub `releases/latest`; prereleases never offered) or `"rc"` (prerelease tags such as `v0.47.0-rc.1` included). **Released builds ignore this field** — the running binary's own version is authoritative (a stable build is never offered an RC; an RC build always tracks `rc`); it only applies to dev/unstamped builds. See [docs/prerelease-builds.md](prerelease-builds.md). |

Both keys are optional and hot-reloadable: editing them (config file or
`POST /api/v1/config/apply`) takes effect without a restart, and re-enabling
triggers a prompt re-check.

**Environment-variable precedence** — the existing switches keep working and
**win over** the config keys (operator override):

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true` | Force-disables update checking even when `update_check.enabled` is `true`. Read by the **core and the macOS tray** — one export silences both, including the tray's one-click updater. |
| `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES=true` | Force-selects the prerelease (`rc`) channel even when `update_check.channel` is `stable`. |
| `CI=true` / `CI=1` | Suppresses every update nudge and the tray's unattended checks (non-interactive context). Machine-readable fields keep reporting the facts, and a user-initiated "Check for Updates" still runs. |

Both keys and both switches are reported to the tray as an explicit contract —
`update_policy` in `GET /api/v1/info` — rather than inferred from missing data.
The macOS one-click updater, the channel matrix and the release-infrastructure
side (feed, enclosure, signing keys) are documented in
[Auto-Update](/features/auto-update).

The env vars only widen in one direction (disable checks / enable
prereleases); they cannot force-enable checking that config disabled — with
`update_check.enabled: false`, checks stay off regardless of environment.

**Check cadence and quiet environments** (Spec 079 US3):

- The background check runs **at most daily** and **backs off on failure**
  (each consecutive failed check doubles the wait, capped at 8× the
  interval) — offline or rate-limited environments are treated as
  "unknown", never retried aggressively and never surfaced as an error.
  A manual `/api/v1/info?refresh=true` bypasses the backoff.
- With `CI=true` (or `CI=1`, the same convention the telemetry filter
  uses) the process is treated as **non-interactive**: the startup
  "Update available" log line is demoted to debug and the `update` payload
  carries `nudges_suppressed: true`, which hides the Web UI banner. The
  machine-readable facts (`mcpproxy status`, `doctor`, `/api/v1/info`)
  are unaffected.

See [Version Updates](features/version-updates.md) for where updates are
surfaced.

## Complete Example

Here's a complete configuration example with all major sections:

**Note:** Leaving `api_key` empty will cause MCPProxy to generate and enforce a new key on startup.

## Environment Variables

Many configuration options can be overridden via environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Config Field | Description |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `MCPPROXY_LISTEN` / `MCPP_LISTEN` | `listen` | Network binding address |
| `MCPPROXY_API_KEY` | `api_key` | API key for authentication (empty values trigger auto-generation; auth remains enabled) |
| `MCPPROXY_TLS_ENABLED` | `tls.enabled` | Enable HTTPS/TLS |
| `MCPPROXY_TLS_REQUIRE_CLIENT_CERT` | `tls.require_client_cert` | Enable mTLS |
| `MCPPROXY_CERTS_DIR` | `tls.certs_dir` | Custom certificates directory |
| `MCPPROXY_DATA` | `data_dir` | Override data directory |
| `MCPPROXY_TOOL_RESPONSE_MODE` | `tool_response_mode` | `retrieve_tools` serialization: `full` (default) or `compact` |
| `MCPPROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | `max_concurrent_requests` | Global aggregate cap on concurrent upstream tool calls (`0` disables it). See [Concurrency Limits](#concurrency-limits--request-queueing) |
| `MCPPROXY_QUEUE_SIZE` | `queue_size` | Global aggregate wait-queue length (`0` = shed at the cap) |
| `MCPPROXY_QUEUE_TIMEOUT` | `queue_timeout` | Global aggregate queue wait budget, e.g. `30s` |
| `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH` | - | Disable OAuth for testing |
| `HEADLESS` | - | Run in headless mode |

**Prefix rules:**
- General settings also accept the `MCPP_` prefix (hyphens become underscores), e.g., `MCPP_TOOLS_LIMIT`, `MCPP_ENABLE_PROMPTS`.
- TLS/listen/data have additional convenience overrides with the `MCPPROXY_` prefix as listed above.

**Priority:** Environment variables > Config file > Defaults

## Validation

MCPProxy validates configuration on startup. Common validation errors:

- **Invalid listen address**: Must be `host:port` or `:port` format
- **Invalid tools_limit**: Must be between 1 and 1000
- **Missing server name**: Each server must have a unique name
- **Invalid protocol**: Must be `stdio`, `http`, `sse`, `streamable-http`, or `auto`
- **Missing command**: stdio servers require `command` field
- **Missing url**: HTTP-based servers require `url` field
- **Invalid timeout**: Must be a valid duration string (e.g., `"30s"`, `"2m"`)

Run `mcpproxy doctor` to check configuration health.
