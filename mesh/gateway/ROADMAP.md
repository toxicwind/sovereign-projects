# MCPProxy Roadmap

> **Generated — do not edit by hand.** This file is rendered from [`roadmap.yaml`](./roadmap.yaml) by [`scripts/gen-roadmap.py`](./scripts/gen-roadmap.py). Edit `roadmap.yaml` and re-run the generator.

The roadmap models cross-spec **epics → tasks** with a dependency DAG, execution `status`, `priority`, and links — the things a per-spec `tasks.md` checkbox list cannot express. Per-spec checkbox progress is recomputed live from each `specs/<NNN>/tasks.md`.

[`roadmap.yaml`](./roadmap.yaml) holds the **working set** (todo · in-progress · in-review · blocked · parked). Cold shipped epics are swept into [`roadmap.archive.yaml`](./roadmap.archive.yaml) and surface in the [Shipped](#shipped-archived) table below, so the working file stays small while provenance survives. A `depends_on:` edge into the archive is satisfied by definition.

## How to regenerate

```bash
python3 scripts/gen-roadmap.py     # writes ROADMAP.md
scripts/gen-roadmap                # convenience wrapper (same thing)
python3 scripts/gen-roadmap.py --check          # CI canary: fail if ROADMAP.md is stale
python3 scripts/gen-roadmap.py --check-github   # cross-check statuses vs live GitHub PR state,
                                                # spec links, depends_on ids, and status sanity
                                                # (add --strict to fail on warnings; needs gh)
python3 scripts/gen-roadmap.py --archive --dry-run   # preview the cold-done sweep
python3 scripts/gen-roadmap.py --archive             # sweep into roadmap.archive.yaml + regenerate
```

## roadmap.yaml schema (short form)

- **epics[]** — each has `id` (stable slug, DAG node), `title`, `status` (todo·in_progress·in_review·blocked·done), `priority` (P0–P3), `depends_on: [ids]` (DAG edges, prerequisite→dependent), optional `parked: true`, and links `spec:` / `pr:` / `mcp:` (external MCP-xxxx).
- **epics[].tasks[]** — child tasks with the same fields; their `depends_on` may reference sibling tasks or other epics.
- See the header comment in `roadmap.yaml` for the full field reference.

## Roadmap at a glance

The cross-epic dependency graph — **one node per epic**, edges point prerequisite → dependent. Task-level detail lives in the collapsible sections below, and dependency-free epics are listed under the graph rather than drawn as disconnected boxes, so this stays legible at default zoom. Node colour = status: 🟢 done · 🔵 in-progress · 🟡 in-review · 🔴 blocked · ⚪ todo · ⚫ parked.

<summary>🔵 Release qualification gate (auto-QA matrix blocks the tag) — In progress · P0</summary>

> Attacks the return cliff (48% of installs are one-and-done; day-1 return 31% — corrected 2026-07-10, identity-deduped; the earlier '17.7% day-2' figure was un-deduped anonymous_id churn) and the one conceded competitor advantage: stability. No release tag until the surface x server-type matrix (MCP/REST/CLI/Web UI x stdio/http/sse/docker/oauth) plus invariants (activity-log/token counters move, quarantine flow, reconnect survival, in-place upgrade) pass automatically; macOS app smoke is advisory until promoted (3 consecutive passes, spec 081 US4). Assembles existing assets: test-api-e2e.sh, Playwright sweep, scan-eval gate, mcpproxy-ui-test.

<summary>🔵 Telemetry identity &amp; data quality (machine_id + CI-filter hardening) — In progress · P1</summary>

> 2026-07-11 source audit: the CLIENT half is DONE and RELEASED — the old framing ('add a hashed machine_id (schema v6)') is stale. machine_id (HMAC-SHA256 of the OS machine id, internal/telemetry/machine_id.go) is emitted unconditionally in every heartbeat (telemetry.go:789; telemetry is opt-out) and shipped in v0.47.0; the client schema is already v7, a version past the v6 this note described; CI is filtered client-side by disabling telemetry outright (env_overrides.go). Worker verified live in prod 2026-07-07 (machine_id 100% populated). The audit also found that the 79%-unknown launch_source was a CLIENT bug misfiled to mcpproxy-dash — a dashboard cannot display a value the client is incapable of sending. That is now fixed (see telemetry-launchsource-tray). Remaining: dashboard consumption (mcpproxy-dash) + snapshot-cron alerting.

<summary>🔵 Telemetry v7: honest funnel + churn instrumentation — In progress · P1</summary>

> 2026-07-06 recheck DEBUNKED the 72.4% connect-skip story: genuine never-connected skip = 0% (wizard dismiss stamped 'skipped' on users who connected via ConnectModal/CLI/manual config). 2026-07-10 recheck debunked the OTHER two spec-080 headline metrics as well: 'day-2 return 17.7%' was un-deduped anonymous_id churn (true, identity-deduped: one-and-done 48%, day-1 return 31%, day-7 16.6% — matches dashboard); '42% retrieve_tools -> 16% real call' was lifetime-flag vs windowed-counter asymmetry (true conversion ~90%; missing piece is a first_real_tool_call_ever activation flag). Real cliff = 48% one-and-done. 2026-07-11 source audit + fix: ALL of spec 080 is shipped and released in v0.47.0 (#813) — T1 wizard completed_external, T2 funnel fields, T3 pre-churn snapshot, US4 schema v7. The previous note claimed 'only cross-repo churn analytics (T4) remains'; that was WRONG — first_real_tool_call_ever had ZERO occurrences in Go code and was in-repo CLIENT work. It is now implemented, so the retrieve->call funnel is finally measurable lifetime-vs-lifetime. P0->P1: only cross-repo T4 now remains.

<summary>🟡 Windows native tray app — In review · P2 · MCP-43</summary>

> No spec: link — this epic is the native TRAY app; specs/002-windows-installer is the unrelated INSTALLER spec (35/60) and its badge said nothing about tray progress (wrong link removed 2026-07-10). Option C: WebView2 window reusing shipped Web UI. Most exit criteria already ship; gaps = native window, toasts, profile submenu, Win11 smoke. Telemetry: Windows = ~23% of GitHub downloads but only ~4% of active installs (downloads→actives ~12:1 vs macOS ~4:1) — gate WebView2 work on finding the funnel break first.

> Corrected CI-filtered telemetry (2026-07-02): ~60% of last-14d active installs run pre-v0.40; latest stable v0.46.0 only 18.7%. Turn the existing internal/updatecheck background poll into a universal, non-intrusive, channel-aware upgrade nudge across every surface. Never blocks/modals; silent offline/CI.

<summary>🟢 Connect step trust: preview, visible backup, one-click undo — Done · P0</summary>

> Legacy wizard telemetry APPEARED to show 72.4% of engaged users skipping the connect step - debunked 2026-07-06: an instrumentation artifact, genuine never-connected skip = 0% (the wizard stamped skipped on users who connected via ConnectModal/CLI/manual config); real cliff is one-and-done installs ~48% (day-1 return 31%, identity-deduped 2026-07-10), see specs/080. Completers retain ~50% at two weeks vs 6% for non-engaged (correlation with engagement, not causation by the connect step). Backups already exist (internal/connect/backup.go) but are invisible in the Web UI. Close the trust gap: preview the exact config diff, surface the backup, offer one-click undo, explain the macOS TCC prompt.

<summary>🟢 Tray↔core decoupling: socket/REST API only, no config-file reads — Done · P2</summary>

> Architecture rule (CLAUDE.md): the tray holds no state and talks to the core only via socket/REST + SSE. 2026-07-11 source-of-truth re-audit + fix: Swift tray was already clean (MCPProxyApp.swift opens the config in an external editor, never parses it); the Go tray's update-check gate was already reworked to core-API gating (#805). The last violation — config.LoadFromFile in the Go tray's OAuth login path, live since ff03db92 (2026-05-18, #477) — turned out to be FUNCTIONALLY DEAD: the loaded config fed only two debug log lines, while the actual trigger was already the core-API TriggerOAuthLogin. Deleted rather than ported to REST. Bootstrap reads (socket path, config PATH without parsing, CA cert) are allowed and remain. Now enforced by a test so the rule cannot silently rot.

| Delete the dead config read in the Go tray OAuth path (config.LoadFromFile) + drop the now-unused internal/config import. GetConfigPath stays on the interface — openConfigDir still needs the path to reveal the dir in the file manager. | 🟢 Done | — |
| Test guard (internal/tray/config_import_guard_test.go) failing any tray-side call to config.LoadFromFile/Load/SaveConfig/... Parses source on disk, so a violation cannot hide behind an inactive build tag. Bans config FILE I/O, not the config package — cmd/mcpproxy-tray legitimately references the config.LogConfig type for its own logger. | 🟢 Done | — |
