# stack.sh — keep an epic's stacked pull requests correct across merges.
#
#   stack.sh track   --repo R --branch B --parent P     # record B as stacked on P
#   stack.sh list    --repo R                           # show the recorded stack
#   stack.sh restack --repo R [--base master]           # rebase + retarget after a merge
#
# restack is silent on stdout except on a conflict, when it prints one line —
#   conflict branch=<b> parent=<p> onto=<sha> from=<sha> worktree=<dir>
# — and exits 1 with the branch untouched, for ship-epic to hand to a resolver.
#
# A stacked branch starts from its blocker's head, not from master, so a dependent
# sub-issue can be worked before its blocker merges. Its pull request opens with
# `--base <blocker-branch>`, so the diff shows only that sub-issue's own work.
#
# This repository squash-merges. A squash rewrites the blocker's commits, so after
# the blocker merges, every branch above it still carries the pre-squash commits
# and its merge base is stale — the diff would re-show the blocker's changes.
# `restack` is what repairs that: it rebases each remaining branch onto its new
# parent, force-pushes, and retargets the pull request.
#
# The parent and the exact commit a branch forked from are recorded in git config
# (`branch.<name>.shipEpicParent` / `.shipEpicBase`). The forked-from commit is the
# part that cannot be recovered later: after a squash merge the blocker branch is
# deleted, so nothing else can tell git which commits are the branch's own.
