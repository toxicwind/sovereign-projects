  Drive one Codex review round on a GitHub PR — request the review, wait until it
  has actually settled, read the head commit's findings, and judge which are already
  resolved. Use when a PR needs a Codex review, when waiting on one, or when
  checking whether its findings are resolved.

# Codex review

This skill drives the repository's GitHub Codex integration. A local `reviewer`
agent, generic code review, or `gh pr checks` is not a substitute: none proves that
GitHub Codex reviewed the PR head. If this skill or its bundled watcher cannot be
loaded, stop and repair the plugin installation rather than silently changing the
review mechanism.

Codex is not a GitHub check — nothing in `gh pr checks` ever reflects it. You post
the `@codex review` trigger, the review lands minutes later in one of two shapes (a
PR review plus inline comments when it has findings; a plain issue comment when it
does not), and the only completion signal is that the bot has covered the head
commit *and* gone quiet for the settle window (120s). `scripts/codex-wait.sh` (in
this skill's directory) encodes all of that:

```
scripts/codex-wait.sh status   <pr> [--quiet]   # snapshot: not-requested | awaiting | arriving | settled
scripts/codex-wait.sh request  <pr> [--force]   # post the trigger (exit 5 = already requested for this head — fine)
scripts/codex-wait.sh watch    <pr>             # block until settled — ALWAYS run backgrounded
scripts/codex-wait.sh findings <pr> [--all]     # head commit's findings, with staleness and resolution counts
```

One round is: `request`, then `watch` as a background command (it blocks up to 15
minutes; end your turn and let its completion re-invoke you — in a harness without
background commands, poll `status` every few minutes instead), then `findings`.

## Rules the script enforces — do not second-guess them

- **Read only a `settled` review.** Codex posts inline comments in bursts *after*
  the review body; reading an `arriving` review gives a truncated finding set and
  you fix half the review.
- **Coverage is the `**Reviewed commit:** <sha>` line**, not timestamps. A review
  of an older commit is not a review of head. Any push moves head, so the state
  returns to `not-requested` — a re-review after fixes is intended, not a bug.
- **A finding's `commit_id` lies.** GitHub advances it as head moves, so an old
  finding reads as new. `findings` reports `raisedOn` (the original commit) for
  exactly this reason.
- **Replies are not resolution.** Branch on `resolverReplyCount` and
  `counts.unresolved`, never `replyCount` — a human asking codex a follow-up is a
  reply too. Resolution is evidenced by a reply carrying the `(resolver, round N)`
  marker; when you resolve or rebut a finding, tag your reply with that marker so
  later rounds count it.
- **`watch` exit 4 means codex still looked silent — confirm before believing it.**
  Check the bot's PR reviews *and* issue comments for a `Reviewed commit:` line
  matching head; a verdict in an unexpected shape is indistinguishable from silence
  at the script's level. If it truly is silent, report that rather than
  re-triggering on a loop.

The round is complete when `counts.unresolved` is zero for the head commit — every
finding either fixed and pushed, or answered with a `(resolver, round N)` rebuttal.
Count prior rounds by that marker in **both** the PR's issue comments and its
review-comment replies; thread replies never appear in `gh pr view --json comments`.
