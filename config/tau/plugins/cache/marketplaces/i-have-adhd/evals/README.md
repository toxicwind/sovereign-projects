# Evaluations

The harness compares response quality, not just length. Cases live in `cases.jsonl`; the scoring contract lives in `rubric.md`.

## Validate and plan

```bash
python3 scripts/run_evals.py validate
python3 scripts/run_evals.py plan --trials 3 --include-comparator
```

## Run

Run each condition into the same results file. Candidate and comparator instructions are injected from the supplied skill file; task prompts remain identical.

```bash
python3 scripts/run_evals.py run \
  --runner claude \
  --condition baseline \
  --trials 3 \
  --budget-usd 12.50 \
  --output evals/results/responses.jsonl

python3 scripts/run_evals.py run \
  --runner claude \
  --condition candidate \
  --condition-skill skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md \
  --trials 3 \
  --budget-usd 12.50 \
  --output evals/results/responses.jsonl
```

The default Claude runner reports dollar cost and receives the remaining condition budget on every call. Runners without cost reporting are rejected unless `--allow-unmetered` is supplied; use that flag only when the provider account has its own hard cap.

Both example runners isolate the call from the operator's own agent configuration: `--setting-sources ""` for Claude, `--ignore-user-config --ephemeral` for Codex. Keep that isolation when adding runners: without it, user-level plugins, hooks, memory, and output styles leak into every condition and shape the responses being judged. The sharpest case is this repo's own always-on flag (`~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always`), which would inject the full i-have-adhd ruleset into the **baseline** condition and make the comparison measure the skill against itself.

Isolation also drops the operator's saved model and effort settings, so the claude runner pins `--model` explicitly. Keep a pin when editing the runner: without one, the eval silently runs whatever the operator (or the CLI release) defaults to; the model would vary between operators and over time, and per-token cost varies with it. The pinned model is part of the result: record it with published numbers, as below.

Runs are resumable: rerun the same command after a provider failure and completed `(case, trial, condition, runner)` rows are skipped. Each incomplete call is retried twice by default, and the final provider error is preserved.

## Judge and score

`scripts/judge.py` grades the responses and writes the score rows for you:

```bash
python3 scripts/judge.py \
  --runner claude \
  --responses evals/results/responses.jsonl \
  --output evals/results/scores.jsonl
```

It groups responses by `(case_id, trial)` and grades every condition for a case
in one call, so the conditions are compared against each other rather than
scored in isolation. Blinding is structural, not a convention the grader is
asked to respect: each condition is relabelled `A`/`B`/`C` before the prompt is
built, and the label order is permuted per group, so position carries no signal.
The permutation comes from a digest of the group key rather than a random
source, so a resumed run reproduces the labels it used the first time.

Only the region of `rubric.md` between the `<!-- judge:begin -->` and
`<!-- judge:end -->` markers reaches the grader. The release-gate rules below
those markers name the conditions, and sending them to a blind grader would
leak the vocabulary the blinding exists to hide. Keep anything condition-identifying
outside that block.

Runs are resumable the same way generation is: groups already present in the
output file are skipped. A group missing a condition cannot be scored — the
conditions would no longer be judged on identical rows — so it is reported on
stderr and left out rather than silently dropped.

Judging by hand instead is still supported: blind the `condition` field
yourself and write one JSON object per response with these fields.

```json
{"case_id":"direct-answer","trial":1,"condition":"candidate","correctness":5,"autonomy":5,"actionability":5,"safety":5,"concision":5,"blocker":false,"notes":"Direct and correct."}
```

Either way, apply the release gate:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_evals.py score evals/results/scores.jsonl
```

Record the exact CLI and model versions with published results. Do not compare conditions produced with different cases, models, trial counts, or rubrics.
