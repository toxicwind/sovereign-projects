## Paired (headline)

| Variant | n | Δ output | p | Δ LOC | p | Δ new-input | p | Δ cost | p | Judge W/L/T | sign p |
|---------|--:|---------:|--:|------:|--:|------------:|--:|-------:|--:|------------:|-------:|
| honey | 23 | -40% | <0.001 | -43% | <0.001 | +2780% | <0.001 | +136% | 0.017 | 5/3/12 | 0.727 |

Every Δ is a **per-task** delta vs `baseline`: runs collapse by median, tasks pair up,
and the column is the median of those paired deltas. `p` is a two-sided Wilcoxon
signed-rank test (`—` when fewer than 6 non-tied tasks — no significance is claimed there).
`(ns)` marks a delta that misses p<0.05: a tie, not a win. **Judge W/L/T** counts tasks
where the variant scored above / below / level with baseline, tested with an exact sign
test — the right test for ordinal, noisy judge scores, and one a mean-of-means can hide.

- **Δ output** — the headline lever: volume each skill directly controls, caching-independent.
- **Δ new-input** — fresh + cache-creation tokens, the class where a skill prompt *costs*.
  Cache reads are excluded: they bill at a tenth and dominate a long session regardless.
- **Δ cost** — all four token classes at `bench/pricing.json` rates.

## Arm totals

| Variant | Tests pass | Judge ±sd | Judge vs base | Output tok | Output vs base | New input tok | $ (cached) | $ (cold) | CO₂ (g) |
|---------|-----------:|----------:|--------------:|-----------:|---------------:|--------------:|-----------:|---------:|--------:|
| baseline | 97% | 94 ±6 | 100% | 91,276 | +0% | 10,791 | $0.467 | $0.467 | 7.7 |
| honey | 100% | 95 ±4 | 101% | 61,392 | -33% | 273,612 | $0.581 | $0.581 | 5.2 |

Volumes and absolute costs. The *vs base* column here is a ratio of sums and is
outlier-sensitive — one long task can drive it; prefer the paired table above.

- **Tests pass** — objective: extracted code run against unit tests.
- **Judge ±sd** — LLM-as-judge (0-100, panel median) with per-record stdev. A judge gap
  inside ±sd is noise, not a quality win. Rubric: `plain`.
- **$ (cached)** — steady state: cache reads at ≈10% of input, cache *creation* charged.
  **$ (cold)** — first-turn worst case: every input token billed fresh. Real cost sits
  between, nearer cached as a session lengthens. Rates in `bench/pricing.json`.
- **CO₂** via EcoLogits port (`hooks/eco.js`), from output tokens.
