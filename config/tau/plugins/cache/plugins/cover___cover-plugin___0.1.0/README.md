# Cover Plugin for Pi and Oh My Pi

`cover-plugin` connects [Cover](https://github.com/DavidCarliez/cover) to the Pi
and Oh My Pi model-provider systems. Cover remains the local privacy boundary;
the plugin only manages provider routing, health, and commands.

Install Cover first, then install the extension:

```sh
pi install npm:cover-plugin

# Oh My Pi: install directly from npm
omp plugin install cover-plugin

# Or use the Cover marketplace
omp plugin marketplace add DavidCarliez/cover
omp plugin install cover-plugin@cover
```

Inside Pi or Oh My Pi, choose exactly which providers must use Cover:

```text
/cover providers openai-codex,deepseek=/
/cover on
/cover doctor
```

OpenAI-family providers default to the `/v1` proxy path. Use `=/` for providers
whose transport supplies its own API path. Custom paths are also supported, for
example `router=/api/v1`.

Commands: `/cover status`, `/cover on`, `/cover off`, `/cover fallback on|off`, `/cover providers`,
`/cover start`, `/cover stop`, `/cover doctor`, and `/cover monitor`.

When protection is enabled, configured providers remain pointed at the local
proxy if Cover stops. Their requests fail locally instead of bypassing Cover.
State is stored in `~/.config/cover/harness.json` with private permissions.

For automatic direct routing when Cover is unavailable, opt in with
`/cover fallback on`. Before each new user turn, the plugin checks Cover. It
restores the provider's original connection settings if Cover is unavailable,
and shows **DIRECT — unprotected**. When Cover returns, protection resumes on
the next user turn. `/cover fallback off` restores the default fail-closed mode.
Existing requests and tool continuations are not replayed directly on failure.
The provider's original connection settings must work independently of Cover.

OMP's plugin enable/disable controls manage plugin loading. They are separate
from starting/stopping the Cover daemon or its automatic fallback policy.

Environment overrides:

- `COVER_BIN`: path to the Cover executable.
- `COVER_BASE_URL`: local proxy URL.
- `COVER_PROVIDERS`: comma-separated provider routes.
- `COVER_HARNESS_DISABLED`: start with integration disabled.
- `COVER_HARNESS_STATE`: alternate state file.
