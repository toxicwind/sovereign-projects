# submit-development-result-artifact

## Overview

A development result is one markdown document
(`artifact_type: "development_result"`) reporting what was done, which
files changed, and — as stable-ID list items — the proof that plan steps
and analysis findings were actually addressed.

Submit with `ralph_submit_md_artifact`; pre-check with
`ralph_verify_md_artifact`.

## Document Shape

Frontmatter: `type: development_result` and exactly one closed-vocabulary
status: `completed`, `partial`, or `failed`. Any other status is invalid and must be
repaired before submission.

Most section rules below apply to `status: completed` only. A
`status: partial` or `status: failed` document is otherwise free-form below the
frontmatter, with two always-enforced exceptions: `## Summary` with at least
one item, and — once the run's cycle timebox has warned — `## Incomplete Work`,
every item carrying a stable-ID bracket, a `Reason:`, and an `Evidence:`. Under
that same warning a `completed` result must carry `## Plan Items Proven`.

The `## Incomplete Work` section is a CLOSED grammar, not free-form: it accepts only top-level `- [ID] text` bullets and their indented `Reason:` / `Evidence:` lines, in a single section. Prose, other bullet markers, numbered lists, nested entries, extra fields, `### [ID]` sub-blocks and a repeated section are all rejected — not because they are wrong to write, but because the report reads none of them, so accepting them would silently delete the work they describe. Put every remaining item in its own stable-ID bullet.
Whether the cycle warned is read from the run's own clock, not from anything
you declare, so the status you pick does not decide whether you are asked to
show your work. Write whatever best records the attempt. Use `partial` when a safe concrete continuation
exists, with `## Next Steps` and `## Continuation` (your session ID). Use
`failed` when no safe developer continuation exists under current evidence or
authority, and report the blocker without promising another iteration. Neither
status decides whether the run ends.

| Section | Required (`completed`) | Items |
|---|---|---|
| `## Summary` | yes | exactly 1 |
| `## Files Changed` | yes | 1+ (one file per item) |
| `## Plan Items Proven` | no (required once the cycle timebox has warned) | one per plan step proven |
| `## Next Steps` | no | exactly 1 |
| `## Continuation` | no | exactly 1: the prior session ID |
| `## Analysis Items Addressed` | no | one per analysis finding addressed |

## ID-Based Proof References

Proof entries reference other artifacts by their stable item IDs — the ID
goes in the `[ID]` slot and the proof is the item text:

- `## Plan Items Proven`: the item ID is the plan step's stable ID
  (`S-1`, `S-2`, …) exactly as it appears in the plan's `## Steps`
  section. The text states concrete evidence. Add an indented
  `Disposition: completed|adapted|not_applicable|blocked` field. Add an
  indented `Rationale:` for adapted, not-applicable, or blocked items. A
  completed result cannot contain blocked work; submit a partial result.
- `## Analysis Items Addressed`: the item ID is the stable ID of the
  `## What Came Up Short` finding in the analysis-decision artifact you are
  answering. The text states concrete evidence that the finding is closed.

Copy the IDs from the source artifact — do not invent or renumber them.

## Core Flow

1. Write the document. For `completed`, every section rule and every
   plan/analysis proof above is enforced. For `partial`, `## Summary` is
   required and — under a cycle-timebox warning — so is `## Incomplete Work`;
   otherwise lead with what you did, what remains (`## Next Steps`) and your
   session ID (`## Continuation`) so the next iteration can resume.
2. Optionally `ralph_verify_md_artifact`, then
   `ralph_submit_md_artifact({"artifact_type": "development_result", "content": ...})`.

Worked example:

```markdown
---
type: development_result
status: completed
---

## Summary

- [SUM-1] Added the foo() regression test, clamped the index in src/foo.py, and verified the focused suite passes.

## Files Changed

- [F-1] src/foo.py
- [F-2] tests/test_foo.py

## Plan Items Proven

- [S-1] tests/test_foo.py contains test_clamp_handles_out_of_range_index.
  Disposition: completed
- [S-2] src/foo.py clamps the index before lookup while preserving the public foo() signature.
  Disposition: completed

## Analysis Items Addressed

- [DA-001] pytest tests/test_foo.py -q passes with the new regression test included.
```

## Error Recovery

- `completed development_result artifacts require summary` (or
  `... require files_changed`) — fill the missing section, or change
  `status` to `partial` if the work is not actually done.
- `Summary must contain exactly one item` / `Next Steps must contain
  exactly one item` / `Continuation must contain exactly one item` —
  these sections are single-item; merge extra items into one line.
- `section requires list items` on `## Files Changed` — list at least one
  changed file.
- Duplicate-ID diagnostics in a proof section — each plan step or finding
  may appear only once; merge the proof text into one item.
