Restart proof: E2E CLI drill + TestRestart (new Dispatcher continues IDs/locks/ledger chain). Triage folded in: sovereign-chat dispatch.ts = internal lease queue (below this layer); fleet/dispatch_fallback.py = transport fallback (complementary); oracle intake = triage front door (this is the dispatch side).'
