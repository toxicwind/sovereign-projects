# llama-swap config.yaml — Audit & Tuning Notes

Audit date: 2026-07-28 · Auditor: agent deep-tune pass · Hardware: RTX 3090 24 GB / 62 GiB RAM

## Fixed in this pass (verifiable defects)

| # | Location | Defect | Fix |
|---|----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | `models.beellama/gemma4-31b-it-dflash-Q4_K_M.cmd` | `${BEELLAMA_BIN}${BEELLAMA_BIN}` — binary path doubled, command could never exec | Single `${BEELLAMA_BIN}` |
| 2 | `macros.CTX_160K` | Referenced undefined `${CS_160K}`. Latent: macro values are only expanded into model cmds that use them, so config loaded today, but any future use of `CTX_160K` would fail config load with "unknown macro" | Added `CS_160K: "163840"` to the context-size ladder |
| 3 | `macros.SPEC_DFLASH_GEMMA` | `--spec-draft-ngl all --spec-dflash-cross-ctx 1024` duplicated back-to-back | Deduplicated |
| 4 | `models.gemma-4-12b-unified.cmd` | Redundant `--no-warmup` (already in `FORK_TURBO`) | Removed duplicate flag |

## Verified healthy (no change needed)

- All 4 fork binaries exist and are executable (beellama, turboquant, ik_llama, ik_turboquant); llama-swap binary OK.
- All 36 GGUF/mmproj paths referenced by macros exist in `/home/toxic/projects/models` (55 files present).
- `routing.scheduler.settings.fifo.priority` — 36 entries, dense unique ladder 0–35, every key resolves to a defined model ID (load-time validated by the fork).
- `routing.router.settings.matrix.vars` — all resolve to real model IDs; `exclusive` set is one giant OR-chain → every member expands to a singleton set → only one resident model at a time. No deadlock possible; maximally conservative for 24 GB.
- `evict_costs` ladder is coherent with the priority ladder (tiny exaone most expensive to evict = keep the cheap fast path resident; per-line offset `priority ≈ evict_cost − 1..−2`).
- `healthCheckTimeout: 300`, `unloadTimeout` default (10 s), `checkEndpoint` default (`/health`), `globalTTL: 600`, `startPort: 25001` (model ports stay below the 25100 frontend).
- `--parallel 1` everywhere — correct for single-user 24 GB card; ctx/batch tiers (`-b 2048 -ub 512`, 256K tiers drop to `-b 1024 -ub 256`) are sane.
- Aliases globally unique (load-time validated).

## Left alone on purpose (ambiguous — do not "fix" blindly)

1. **`beellama/qwen-flash-mtp-64k` has no fifo priority** (defaults 0) while its matrix evict_cost is 17 and every sibling tier has a priority. The priority ladder is deliberately unique 0–35; by the Qwen-Flash line pattern (`priority = evict_cost − 2`) it would be 15, but 15 is taken by `beellama/gemma-128k`. Adding a duplicate would break the unique-ladder design. Impact is queue-ordering only. Decide intent before touching.

2. **Models absent from the matrix** (`qwen/27b-dflash-q4km`, `qwen/27b-mtp-ud-q4xl`, `gemma-4-21b-moe-reap`, `beellama/gemma4-31b-it-dflash-Q4_K_M`, both `ik_turboquant/*`, all drafter/utility models) can only run alone — functionally identical to being in the singleton `exclusive` set, so there is no behavioral gap today. Adding them to the OR-chain would only be cosmetic.

3. **`qwen3.6-27b-dflash-iq4xs-mtp` (~27 GB) will not fit 24 GB** — self-flagged in metadata. Worse: its `SPEC_DRAFT_MTP_QWEN36` draft is `Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-UD-Q4_K_XL` (~16 GB), a draft nearly as large as the target. A request evicts everything, then fails health check after up to 300 s. Kept because it is documented and may be intended for a future 48 GB+ card; consider `unlisted: true` or removal if it causes production stalls.

4. **DFlash targets carry no `--spec-type dflash` flags** (`qwen/27b-dflash-*`, `beellama/qwen-flash-dflash-*`, `gemma-4-12b-dflash`) and `SPEC_DFLASH_QWEN` / `SPEC_DFLASH_GEMMA` are defined but unused. Presumably DFlash is engaged client-side or the targets double as draft pools. Rewiring speculative flags without a live acceptance-rate benchmark would be guessing.

5. **Unused macros** (harmless, kept as a toolbox): `SPEC_DRAFT_SIMPLE`, `SPEC_DRAFT_MTP_BASE`, `SPEC_DRAFT_MTP_UNCENS`, `CTX_160K`, `SAMP_*`, `KV_PRECISE`, `KV_BALANCED`, `MMPROJ_27B_F16`, `MMPROJ_GEMMA_F16`, `MMPROJ_HOLO_31_F16`, `MMPROJ_QWEN36_27B_F16`, `QWEN36_27B_UD_Q4XL` (duplicate of `QWEN36_CEREBELLUM`'s path).

6. **Single giant exclusive set means no co-residency**, e.g. exaone (~2 GB) + qwen-flash-64k (~9 GB) could easily share the card. A `fastpath: "exa1 & qf64"`-style set would unlock that, but it changes swap semantics fleet-wide — needs a deliberate decision, not an audit drive-by.

7. **`logLevel: debug` + `logToStdout: both`** is noisy for a daemon; presumed intentional during fork development.

8. **`beellama/gemma4-31b-it-dflash-Q4_K_M` metadata `vram: ~9GB`** is implausible for a 31B Q4_K_M at 128K (expect ~18–20+ GB; OOM risk on 24 GB). Metadata-only, does not affect execution; left with its existing `warning` field.

9. **`df96` and `qdf27` are duplicate matrix vars** for the same model (`qwen/27b-dflash-iq4xs`). Harmless (same singleton set twice); kept to avoid churn in the routing matrix.
