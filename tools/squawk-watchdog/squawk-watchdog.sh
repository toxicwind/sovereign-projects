# It ONLY ever starts things that are down; it never stops or restarts
# anything healthy. Safe to run alongside manual worker restarts.
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-14): both daemons "died silently" twice each.
# Root cause was never the daemons: fleet workers ran
# `pitchfork supervisor stop/start/--force` (5x on 2026-09-14), which kills
# every managed child, and the replacement supervisor was always started
# WITHOUT --boot, so boot_start daemons never came back on their own.
# pitchfork retry=true only covers crashes under a LIVE supervisor.
