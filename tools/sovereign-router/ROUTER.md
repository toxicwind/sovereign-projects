# Sovereign Router v3.2 — Resilient Multi-Provider LLM Router

OpenAI-compatible chat router on `http://127.0.0.1:25104`, supervised by
pitchfork (`sovereign/sovereign-router`). Bun/TypeScript single binary
(`tools/sovereign-router/sovereign-router-ts/`).

## Architecture

```
client -> :25104/v1/chat/completions
            ├─ normalizeModelSpec()      # router-side Openfang-shim parsing
            ├─ routeHybrid()             # explicit -> hedgedChain(explicit+field)
            │                            # auto     -> sticky -> routeAstRace -> chain
            ├─ routeAstRace()            # first-substantive-wins parallel race
            ├─ hedgedChain()             # speculative hedging (HFT redundant feeds)
            ├─ routeCascade()            # FrugalGPT-style cheap→dear cascade
            └─ Matrix (router_matrix.ts) # Elo, circuits, quarantine, latency EMA
                └─ HealthDB (SQLite WAL) # requests, healing log, sticky sessions
```

**Providers (9):** `llama-swap` (local herd :25100, no auth), `kimi-auto`
(local shim :25105 → resolver's best Kimi, no auth), `nim-local` (local NIM
proxy :8000), `openrouter`, `nvidia` (multi-key rotation + per-key token
bucket), `groq`, `cerebras`, `google`, `mistral`.

**Strategies** (`SOVEREIGN_STRATEGY`): `hybrid` (default), `ast_race`,
`circuit_chain`, `cascade`, `weighted`, `fifo`, `sticky`, `free`.

## v3.2 resilience features

- **Fail-fast ceilings**: `SOVEREIGN_CONNECT_MS` (8s), `SOVEREIGN_TTFT_MS`
  (45s), per-attempt totals. A hanging backend never holds a client hostage.
- **Exponential quarantine**: 3 consecutive failures → circuit opens with
  backoff `30s * 2^(level-1)` capped at 10 min. Successful requests reset.
- **Active re-probe**: open circuits are probed on backoff expiry
  (open → half → closed); `/status` shows `probe_in_s`.
- **Warm standby** (HFT): local providers get a 30s `/models` liveness ping
  via `state.recordProbe()` — strikes + circuit only, **no Elo inflation, no
  DB rows**. A dead local backend quarantines before user traffic hits it.
- **Hot key reload**: `POST /admin/reload` or `SIGHUP` reloads secret files
  without restart.
- **`/status`**: per-provider circuit detail, last error, Elo, live models,
  p50/p95 latency (SQLite, 30 min window), kimi-auto resolved model.
- **`X-Sovereign-Timings`**: every chat response ships
  `connect_ms / ttft_ms / total_ms` per-hop timings.

## HFT synthesis (the novel part)

Chris's HFT doctrine (race redundant paths first-valid-wins, fail-fast
ceilings, push-not-poll, hot persistent connections, measure every hop,
fallback planned before primary) applied to LLM routing:

1. **Speculative hedging** (`hedgedChain`): the preferred lane gets a head
   start; if no winner within `SOVEREIGN_HEDGE_MS` (1500ms), the whole
   remaining field races in parallel. First substantive wins; losers are
   aborted and their aborts are **not** circuit strikes. A lane that fails
   fast immediately triggers the next lane. Providers with recent strikes
   lose the lane-0 head start (they still race at the hedge).
2. **First-substantive-wins race** (`routeAstRace`): previously waited for
   *all* lanes (`allSettled`) — the slowest lane set the pace. Now the first
   substantive finisher wins; code-shaped (`isAst`) output keeps priority
   via a 250ms quality window.
3. **Latency-aware ordering**: per-provider latency EMA (α=0.2) feeds
   `candidateScore() = Elo − EMA_ms/50`. Chronic slowness demotes a provider
   even with higher Elo; a single outlier cannot decide alone.
4. **Push-not-poll kimi-auto**: `fs.watch` on the resolver's `state.json`
   keeps `/status`'s resolved-model marker instant; the shim reads state
   live per request.
5. **Per-hop telemetry**: `X-Sovereign-Timings` on every response; p50/p95
   per provider in `/status`.

Measured: hedge fires at ~1500ms (test); blackholed-backend failover serves
200 via the next provider with zero client failures; dead backend
auto-quarantines via warm standby; prober heals on recovery (open → half →
closed, traffic returns).

## Openfang configuration

Point Openfang at the router as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```
base_url = http://127.0.0.1:25104/v1
model    = auto            # router picks (Elo + latency + health)
# or model = "llama-swap:<id>" / "kimi-auto" / "nvidia/..." for pinning
```

Known Openfang bug (worked around router-side): `openfang agent set` can
place `nvidia:<model>` wholly into the model field while preserving the old
provider. The router's `normalizeModelSpec()` parses `provider:model` and
`provider/model` forms and routes them to the right provider, so the mangled
spec still works — verify with `/openfang/resolve?spec=<spec>`.

## Tests

`bun test tests/hedge.test.ts` (8 tests): hedged second-lane wins at
~1500ms, loser aborts take no circuit strike, strike-demotion of lane 0,
spec normalization (colon/slash/bare), exponential quarantine via synthetic
probes, latency-EMA scoring. Uses a temp SQLite DB (`SOVEREIGN_DB`).

## Failover demo (2026-09-20, live)

1. Baseline explicit `llama-swap:beellama/exaone-4-0-1-2b-iq4xs` → 200,
   `X-Routed-Via: llama-swap/…` (1378ms).
2. `iptables DROP` on :25100 → identical request → **200** via
   `nvidia/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`. Zero failed client requests.
3. Warm standby quarantined llama-swap (3 strikes, circuit open, backoff);
   `/status` showed the strike trail.
4. Block removed → quarantine prober re-probed (open → half) → next real
   request succeeded → circuit closed, traffic returned to llama-swap.
5. Lesson applied: kimi-auto shim's 120s upstream timeout → 8s fail-fast so
   a dead herd surfaces 502 immediately instead of hanging the chain.

## Opportunities (running list)

- Weighted timeout strikes: `ttft_timeout`/`attempt_timeout` count double
  (a hanging provider quarantines in 2 requests, not 3).
- Persistent keep-alive pool to cloud providers (amortize TLS handshake;
  microsecond audit showed 150–670ms per cold handshake).
- Chain-level give-up for all-dead scenarios (fast 503 instead of waiting
  out hangers).
- Concurrency sweeps + p95 methodology doc (per the HFT microsecond audit).
